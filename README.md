# Statistical Natural Language Processing in R

This repository accompanies a two day introductory course on natural language processing in R. This course provides participants with:

-	an introduction to statistical natural language processing in R
-	a solid foundation for using textual data in a quantitative and statistical manner in R
-	a basis for more advanced natural language processing analyses
-	confidence in using (large scale) textual data with modern natural language processing methods

## Brief outline

The past ten years have seen landmark advances in natural language processing and an increasing interest in the use of textual data in psychological research. This course will enable participants to use fundamental and modern natural language processing techniques in R to use textual data in a quantitative manner (e.g., for statistical modelling, to measure constructs from text, as features in machine learning approaches). It will also make participants confident in handling textual data in R and provide the conceptual understanding needed for advanced natural language processing as well as generative (artificial intelligence) models. The course consists of brief lectures on the key concepts of statistical natural language processing and guided practicals in R.


## Assumed level of participants

Participants should be familiar with R and have a masterâ€™s level understanding of quantitative methods. Prior experience with natural language processing is not needed.

## Target audience

The workshop is directed at PhD researchers and research master students:

-	intending to use textual data in a quantitative, statistical manner
-	seeking to use textual data with machine learning approaches
-	seeking to understand the foundation of modern generative language models
