1,6,Anxiety,2,2,5,5,5,4,4,4,"I am more worried about getting access to my normal healthcare at  the moment, than being concerned about Corona. My usual treatments have been halted, so my health will deteriorate even if I don't catch the virus!
I am struggling to get routine prescriptions and medical appointments, which is making me feel powerless and anxious.
I am also feeling very sad, as I can not see my children and grandchildren and can not celebrate birthdays and anniversaries with them.
I have been advised to stay inside my house for twelve weeks. The thought of this is making me unhappy, as all that I want to do is to go outside for a walk, but that is not possible right now.",6,Anxiety,4,4,6,6,8,5,5,5,"I am hopeful that the vaccine will help to bring back normality, but I am also worried that sending children back to school next week will start another wave of the virus, as numbers of infected people are still quite high.
I hope that I can see my family again soon. It has been a tough year for us all. Five loved ones have died, and a new baby has been born. We have not been able to either mourn the loses or celebrate the new baby. It has been a time of mixed emotions for us all and we need to know that we can come together some time soon to support each other."

I think the situation will get worse of the next few weeks but, hopefully, will then start to slowly improve. I'm worried what state the country will be left in as so many businesses will close down and the way we live in this country will be changed forever. So many small businesses and self-employed workers will struggle to survive. I am hopeful that a vaccine will be developed before the end of the year.",4,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,3,6,7,4,"Over the past twelve months, there has been little to look forward to with the constant lockdowns and other restrictions. At the moment, I think the current situation is starting to look better than it has for the last twelve months. Now that more and more people are being vaccinated, the infection rates and deaths are starting to fall rapidly. I think that provided that people respect the rules for a few more months then, hopefully, life can start getting back to something like normal later this year."

I have concern for older relatives, particularly my mother, and for other people I know in the community. I'm trying to remain positive and look ahead to the end of the lockdown period whenever that may be.",4,Relaxation,2,2,3,3,5,5,6,2,"I feel the Corona situation is getting better, however I also feel it has been badly mismanaged by the government. I feel saddened at the amount of avoidable deaths that have occurred because we didn't lockdown soon enough on 3 occasions, I feel angry at the way the government has tried to blame people for behaving badly when they made the biggest mistakes. I feel like the recovery will hit the poorest hardest and that will be incredibly unfair. Once the situation has been improved, I suspect the NHS will once again be left to fend for itself and won't be funded to the degree that is necessary. I suspect that the government will seize the opportunity to impose more austerity on the population."

The issue of grocery shopping is a stress too, as it is almost impossible to get a delivery slot, so I may need to go to the supermarket, which is not exactly in keeping with the lockdown and social distancing.
It feels a little claustrophobic at times being stuck indoors.

I just want things back to how they were, with being able to go where you wanted, when you wanted and without having to wear or see masks everywhere I go. I am no longer feeling tolerant about it. I am also quite sceptical that the vaccine will enable us to get back to normal, I think the government will be too slow and I am not a fan of vaccine passports either as I think this will limit a lot of people in doing the things that they want to do, or travelling where they want."

I feel quite hopeful for the future and that life will feel a little more 'normal' soon. I am eager to start making plans for myself and my family to have days out and enjoy life again. I'm feeling a little anxious at the same time as I am worried that we might have to endure more lockdowns and restrictions if the figures start going in the wrong direction again.

I feel in a constant state of limbo, always waiting for the next announcement or development. I feel unable to make any long term plans or decisions. I think that the government is doing as well as they can, there are no right answers in this situation, only a choice of least wrong ones."
9,7,Anxiety,4,2,6,8,4,1,2,1,"After resigning myself to the lockdown situation, I planned to do my best for my family and myself by self isolating and felt that was the right thing to do,

As a result, I have been frustrated with monitoring news about other people, and seeing how they have not adhered to the recommendations of isolation - for the good of themselves and others. This has left me feeling frustrated.

All in all, I feel drained, anxious and have negative feelings for the near future, especially as I have given the situation some thought and can see some illogical reasoning going on, such as distanving musct go ahead but the governement not doing anything to distance key workers when they have to travel by public transport.",6,Anger,6,3,4,4,4,2,2,6,"I have good feelings of my local area and country as a whole, due to the high take up of the vaccine.

I am however dismayed by mixed messages given by government rules, such as not allowing travel .locally, but allowing flights to different countries.

On the whole, I have glimmer of hope and start seeing light at the end of the tunnel, as far as lock-down goes.

I have personal hopes increased especially, as I have recently received my vaccination, and was happy to see a high turnout for the vaccination when I went to receive mine."

Now Boris Johnson is very poorly it has made me very jittery poor man,  brings home how anybody can be affected and he was saying eariler he had only mild symptons yet a week later he is in ICU.   I wake up in the mornings and realise this is not all a dream just the reality of 2020 I just hope me and my family get through this.",8,Anxiety,3,3,6,8,5,7,7,5,"I am anxious that when things start lifting that  cases will go up again,  already people are breaking the lockdown rules which annoys me.  I and my family have obayed the lockdown rules and I have not left my home since christmas apart from getting vaccinated.  I am lucky living in the countryside we have walks around us so easy to stay local for exercise. I don't want to go shopping so have everything delivered at the moment including groceries.  I am proud to be able to say we have stayed safe."

They do not seem to understand that they could be carriers of the virus and could kill someone else with their stupidity, I am having to stay at home due to an autoimmune illness so why can't they. I think this will go on for a longer than it needs to unless there is a lock down that stops people doing what they want to. I am worried and scared as I do not want to die because of someones else being careless. ",8,Anxiety,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,"I am hoping that the rate doesnt go up as soon as the children go back to school.

There will be another lockdown son. They keep lifting measures too soon. They listen to the public instead of us listenijg to them. Other countries are much more strict and getting better results. We should have a full tough lockdown."

If attitudes don't change soon they may either go on until next year or never get any better.
As a key worker myself (as well as my wufe) I am constantly anxious about infection and bringing it home to my children.

15,4,Anger,8,1,2,2,2,4,6,6,"I am angry due to the fact that people are unaware of the fact that Corona virus is a common flu virus and anybody who has got flu in the past will still have it in their body.  There is no test out as yet for covid19 (if there is any virus like that at all).  The figure of people infected is just magnified artificially as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tested positive"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".  The cause of death despite of being from other health factors/condition is classified as covid death.  This pandemic is a global cover up for something more sinister.",1,Anger,9,4,2,2,2,7,7,7,"At this moment of time the social media and the mainstream channels have been overtaken by the government to forward their global re-set agenda as announced by the UN.  Covid is just an excuse to usher their agenda.  To accept this agenda they will have to control the masses or their agenda will fail.  All these laws like isolation, lockdown, vaccinations, covid passports, etc are ways to control the population so that they could not rebel and the re-set goes on smoothly.  Covid virus death rate is less than one percent which is less than that of influenza virus, but the media is spreading lies all around that this is a dangerous virus causing a pandemic.  Small businesses are destroyed by lockdown so that their independent income is destroyed and they kneel down to the government.  This re-set is the brainchild of the elite who control their own organisations like UN, UNESCO, WHO. IMF etc and in turn these organisations control the government of countries.  People like Bill Gates, G. Soros, Rothchilds, Morgan etc have invested billions in vaccinations and to bribe these institutions and social media so that they only give false informations about this fake pandemic and to frighten the people.  We can only stand up to these powers by not believing what they say, protest against lockdown, say no to vaccines and PCR test.  The gene therapy (mRNA vaccine) is the worst thing going around and it will have side effects in the coming months.  This in particular is the population reducing strategy.  You don't have to search for evil anywhere, they are here staring at you in your face.   "

Also the fact that you can't physically go shopping, or get a Mcdonalds or anything is annoying. All because China can't be trusted. They've done it many times before creating pandemics, and they're pretty much the only country that has. You wouldn't see huge flu pandemics originating in the United Kingdom! There should be laws placed on the things they do in that country. 

However at this precise moment I am trying not to think about it too much so I'm fairly relaxed. I don't really watch the news, go on Facebook etc because it's all people can talk about and I've had enough of seeing it.",2,Disgust,6,9,2,3,7,2,4,4,"I am really fed up with the social isolation and how long this has been going on for. I don't really think we'll all be free in June like Boris says, they always come up with a new agenda to stop people having their freedom.

Kids are also being cheated out of a good education as they're never at school anymore. "

I wake up with a sense of resignation, knowing that I won't see anyone or do anything interesting. One of the only good things is that I can work from home and for me this is so much better. I don't have to worry about commuting, so I don't waste that extra time and money. I can now focus on hobbies such as learning languages.",4,Sadness,2,2,2,7,7,3,4,3,"I have now had the vaccine, so I feel slightly more hopeful.

What's happening in the world is horrible, there's no doubt about that, it incredibly sad to see and hear of so many deaths in the world because of this awful disease and I really do hope that we find a way to contain/cure this soon and save as many lives as possible.

Looking for a silver lining, however, I'm working from home and my mental health has massively improved because of it. My day usually involves waking at 5am, driving 30 miles to work usually stressing out in traffic, and once I get to work I'm tired before I've even started, then I have to do it again in the evening, usually getting home late in the evening, not having time to cook properly because I just want a few hours on the couch to switch off before I have to go to bed and get up at 5am again.
With my current working from home situation, I'm getting twice as much sleep as I normally do (usually only get around 4 or 5 hours tops), I'm not stressed and tired from driving for over an hour, I'm able to switch off at a reason time in the early evening and actually cook healthier meals, spend more time with my partner etc.
So although the whole reason we're in this mess is awful, by being forced to stay home and work, my mental and physical health has hugely improved.",3,Relaxation,4,4,3,4,6,4,7,6,"I have had mixed feelings about Covid from the start. I've followed all the advice, taken all precautions etc so I'm sad to see such a devastating effect it's had on millions of families around the world, from death to financial losses.

On the flip side to this, I am quite an independent person who genuinely likes to stay in, watch movies, play games, play the guitar, work on my garden etc - so having the pressure of being a 30 something who is usually socially expected to be 'out and about' all the time taken away from me has made me more relaxed.

I also think that Covid in a way has saved my life. I haven't had the virus myself, but the shift in working from home and offering that flexibility in working hours and locations has been a game changer for me. I'm no longer getting up at 5am every day to do a 1 hour commute to work and being tired before I've begun, and then doing it again at the end of a long day. I get more sleep, I am more rested, I save hundreds of pounds extra a month from being at home rather than commuting, and I get to spend more time with my partner - the work/life balance has never ever been better for me which has led to me being more happy "

I think people aren’t taking this seriously but the government should put orders out rather than instructions as there are people that think they will be the only ones going out etc. but that isn’t the case. I don’t understand how people are thinking like that or why people are letting them go out etc. as I know that if I said something about going out or whatever that people would tell me to stay in and hold me accountable.,6,Anxiety,3,5,6,9,3,3,3,1,"I am hopeful that this will be the last lockdown, however I do not fully trust the government.

 I am enjoying having no deadlines and the freedom that that brings but I miss the structure of the day when I was working and the children were at school.

We are self isolating ( in two separate households) and feel relatively safe at the moment, but until a vaccine is available, the threat will remain. We expect scientists to achieve this within a year. I'm so glad we have the internet and phone to keep in touch with family, and would feel distraught if these lines of communication were cut.

"
64,6,Desire,8,6,3,6,6,6,3,8,"I am one of the people who got a letter saying to stay in for 12 weeks so for me I am not anxious about when the lockdown will end because it won't end for me. I have severe asthma so I am a bit worried about getting it because I have a high risk of needing ventilation and of dying from it. Staying in really isn't an issue for me. I have been living with chronic illness since I was 12 and at my worst I was housebound for 2 years as a teenager so this is nothing compared to that. It has actually been annoying and anger inducing to see so many people complain about the lockdown and staying in, especially if they are middle class/rich with nothing to really worry about, when I have been through worse and was completely ignored and forgotten about like so many others and the key workers are going through much worse too. People are finally experiencing what it is like to live as a disabled person where you have to cancel and grieve for events, stay in for days at a time and survive on what little money the government decides is enough for a week. But still these people can go out and exercise and we still can't. It is also very anger-inducing to see so many people flaunt the rules and go out for BBQs and sunbathing. Also plenty of people going out for 'exercise' are gathering in groups and not observing the 2-meter distance with strangers. I also find it sad that the scientific literacy is so poor in this country. People really don't understand simple things that are being told to them about how the virus works, the symptoms, when to self isolate and what the lockdown means. People are dying every day because of this stupidity. There are also way too many stupid people trying to take down 5G masts because they are transmitting the virus. There are no words for that level. I find there is a bit of toxic positivity and toxic productivity on facebook and social media in general. Like people sharing the numbers of recovered to focus on the positives because everyone else is talking about how many died when these deaths matter. It isn't just the flu. A few days ago a 13 year old died alone and now he has been buried alone with no funeral. I don't want to hear about the recovered because that shouldn't be the focus and people need to be more scared and panicked so they stay indoors and don't get complacent. There should be video from the ICUs on the TV every night to make people think. Many of my friends are taking up new hobbies and getting round to decluttering and finishing those jobs around the house you never end up doing. This is great for them and I am happy they can have some time where they aren't burned out by work constantly but it makes me feel bad because I can't do that. Being as ill as I am is like a full time job and my spare energy goes on cooking, showering and if I am lucky cleaning. I had a migraine yesterday and the most I managed to do was water my plants. I won't be joining my friends in fun creative pursuits and making my space nicer to live in during the lockdown.   I have had some darker thoughts too that maybe we deserve this. I don't believe in any higher power or some personification of mother nature but this has revealed the true nature of humanity in the west. When this started at first people just got really racist ranging from joking about Kung Flu to actually beating up ethnically Chinese people who may never have been to China. Then there was the panic buying of everyone for themselves and protecting their own and screw the rest. A week later I saw images of bins filled with rotting food they had over-purchased whilst elderly and disabled people went hungry because there was nothing in the shops or they couldn't book an online slot. Panic buying continued at pharmacies and now people are short on necessary prescription medication. And now there are people breaking social distancing for selfish reasons like when everyone treated it like a bank holiday and went to Mount Snowdon or just didn't bother because they would be fine if they got the virus. No care about those of us who are the worst affected. Even my aunt who is a nurse went out whilst having the virus to get shopping and medication and could have spread it to many more. It is just a shame that this virus disproportionately affects the elderly and sick and doesn't target selfish and stupid people instead. Now my main worry is about the antibody test because the government wants to get the country and the economy going because money matters most and will possibly allow those who are immune back to work and leave the rest of us behind. It could be that the healthy and young can go back to work and I will still be left behind until there is a vaccine. I really can't risk my life and will lose even more of it than I already have to illness if most people go back to normal. Right now everyone has been dragged nearer to my level so for me that feels okay and something I can live with. My friends are doing virtual socials and chatting online more when usually I have to cancel party invitations and skip nights out. I do have an academic interest in this too as I studied infectious diseases before so it has been frustrating to see the government go against a lot of public health research but interesting to read the latest articles on the biology of the virus. I am probably one of the few who is not getting scared at reading about the virus itself even though I am susceptible to it",7,Anxiety,8,3,6,8,6,6,2,1,I feel very conflicted right now. I am hopeful for the future and about to have my vaccine and can see some things returning to normal. But I am also angry about how the UK handled this as we have some of the worst death rates in the world and the money wasted on things that were meant to help us but went to the friends of politicians. I am also realistic and I follow a lot of scientists on this and know that the vaccine is unlikely to be the end of the pandemic as most 3rd world countries will have to wait years for it and there will be those who refuse it. Plus the virus will mutate and the vaccine gives evolutionary pressure yet we aren't looking at permanent vaccination centres or how we would deal with this. I have been shielding for nearly a year now and want to feel safe but I feel most people my age just want to go back to the pub. I also feel that disabled people have been largely forgotten. I have severe asthma that doesn't count for group 6 with the vaccine but I am too fat and getting it for that reason. I think obese people should have the vaccine as we are at risk but I am sad that thin people who have asthma as bad as mine and are young have to wait

I don't think the restrictions have been enforced enough and the ignorance of done people is shocking.

I can't wait to be able to move around more freely and go out when I want to and not worry about catching this deadly virus.

I think in the future the world will be better prepared in the event that another pandemic arrives.,6,Anxiety,4,5,6,7,4,4,6,4,"I feel frustrated because there is a lot of mixed information about the Corona situation in the media and among the public such as about the effectiveness of mask wearing, the effectiveness of vaccines and whether the virus is on the retreat.

I feel that the lockdowns to reduce the spread of the virus are having a negative effect on the economy and people's livelihoods without ample evidence that they are necessary.

I think that it will take a long time for society to recover from the pandemic and there could be long term mental health issues that effect people for years to come."

75,6,Relaxation,2,1,1,3,2,8,8,2,"I am fairly worried about the rising death toll and what that will mean for my family and friends. However, I have been in self-isolation for nearly 20 days now and the crisis feels remote. I am relaxing and spending my time reading, doing university work, exercise and other activities. 

I wonder if I will be required to volunteer at any point during the crisis. I worry that, once my university deadlines have passed, I will feel a bit aimless and without purpose. I am trying to set myself goals in the long term to account for this.",2,Desire,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,6,"I'm hopeful for the future, especially now that vaccination has started across the world. I am looking forward to seeing my friends and family again. I want to make the most of the summer. I get slightly frustrated towards those who break the rules as I feel they are putting us back in our progress to beat the virus. However, I do understand that people's wills are failing and most of us are doing our best to behave in a way that protects public health while improving our own mental health. I am often tempted to break the rules. I am grateful and feel lucky that I have university studies to focus on and a placement to go to, as I imagine being stuck in the house all day would be very depressing and unstimulating."
76,8,Anxiety,2,2,8,9,6,5,3,2,I feel extremely anxious. I am a high-risk person as I have multiple auto-immune diseases and I have asthma. I think people do not take it seriously enough and people should be following the rules more carefully. They are putting other peoples lives at risks and it makes me very scared. I worry about the future and how long this will last. Things seem so uncertain right now and it is impossible to tell whether it will get better soon or if it will take a long time for things to go back to how they used to.,7,Anxiety,1,1,5,6,2,4,2,1,Being stuck isolating is very much a toll on my mental health. My feelings of anxiety have gone through the roof and I'm finding it quite hard. I dislike complaining though as we are doing this to help everyone and I feel determined to get through this all and work together to make it through the other side. I feel optimistic about that future and hopeful that things will return to normal. I am anxious about  my current employment though. I am struggling to get by financially but am also scared to put myself or my family at risk right now.
77,8,Anxiety,6,6,8,9,7,4,3,3,I've just heard about Boris Johnson being moved to intensive care so it feels very surreal and my anxiety has intensified. I feel unmoored and anxious. I don't see an end to this which is very hard to come to terms with. When i have delay with anxiety before i have told myself things are temporary and will change but this is hard in current situation. I am scared for my children and my parents but there is nothing that i can do. Sometimes it feels so unreal that i can disaasociate from it for a while but it soon creeps back.,7,Anxiety,4,3,6,8,9,5,5,2,"I feel that although within the uk there are glimmers of hope with the vaccine i still feel very sad. Whilst my family and i have been very lucky the repetition and monotony of the situation are grinding me down and sometimes it feels unbearable. When sad/down previously i have always been able to reassure myself that it was a temporary situation and that things would change, now i don't feel that and i am sad and afraid for my children's future. The covid pandemic seems to be intersecting with a lot of other things that i am worrying about, climate change, problems at work etc, and everything feels hopeless. Not every day is miserable, we can still have fun together but i still repeatedly. return to this state of sadness."
78,8,Relaxation,2,1,4,3,1,7,9,1,"I am angry about our government not taking it seriously. Not enforcing lockdown as the virus is still spreading and hasn’t peaked. 
I’m scared about catching it and not being able to breath. 
I’m incredibly sad for those who have died alone. This is also something that I really fear! 

I do go out for my walk daily. But I have developed more of a fear of going to the shop for food it seems more risky.
I don’t think we are being given enough information, and direction. 
Italy is still in lockdown. Totally lockdown I do worry and wonder if that time will come for us.

How many more people need to die! 
I’m also hopeful that people will realise there is more to life than social media and money! ",8,Relaxation,1,1,1,3,1,8,8,2,"I am scared to catch the virus although I do everything I can to keep myself safe I am still aware that it could happen. 
I am desperate for the vaccine and feel positive towards what outcome it can give the world. 
I just want to be safe, the world doesn’t have to instantly go back to normal but I want to feel safe doing some normal things! 
I also really miss my parents who live abroad and I want to be able to travel to them safely! 
I am a little bit worried about getting some side effects from the vaccine but so far people I know have been ok! 
I do fear getting covid and not being able to breath, suffocation is a fear of mine so this does fill me with horror! 
The whole covid situation has also hugely effected my anxiety with normal situations and will no doubt cause me bigger issues when we are allowed to travel and be more normal again!

For those that are fighting for their lives, I hope they pull through.  I have hope that all will be well in the end.  This shall pass, we shall overcome this by God's grace. We are all in this together as this situation has affected the whole world and not just certain parts of it. I salute all those working in the frontline, the NHS and all those volunteering at this time.",4,Anxiety,2,1,2,7,2,5,6,5,"I feel  hopeful that things are getting better the covid infection rates are decreasing and there are fewer deaths this week.  lm in a better space mentally compared to before. I'm  hoping life will gradually get back to some sort of normalcy. The situation currently is not as bleak as it was at the beginning of the year and I'm coping with the present Corona situation much better than I was previously. I'm feeling optimistic about the future and look forward to the Summer as this will help lift my spirits and hopefully  I will be able to visit my family and friends, go out a bit more."
80,8,Anxiety,4,3,6,9,6,2,2,2,"I feel quite anxious and worried about the whole situation. I worry about the health of my family,  especially if they have to go to hospital and have to die on their own. I have a grand son who has special needs. He has been waiting for 2 years for help and now we have no idea when he will get the help he needs. I worry about my daughter on her own with a special needs child 24 hours a day , 7days a week, i worry this will break her. I worry about y sons job , he has a young family to support and a wedding to pay for next year. I also worry about the whole economy of the country, i think we will be paying for this for a very long time.",3,Sadness,6,5,1,5,9,2,2,2,"I feel the last year has been a complete waste of time. i find it hard to find anything to be positive about. So much time wasted, so much debt, how will we ever pay for all this.Will we have to lock down every few months for ever more. What long term affects will this have on our children. So many people suffering with depression and anxiety,people losing their buisnesses  . Its all so incredibly sad and frustrating and depressing. Will we ever get back to normal. will we ever be able to take our face masks off. Will we ever have normal christmas's , family parties again."
81,9,Fear,6,2,9,9,9,2,3,2,"I feel very fearful about the Coronovirus situation. I'm worried for myself and my partner and our families if we get sick. Within our family there are family members with MS and COPD who we are even more worried about. I am sad that I can't see my family for goodness knows how long, but this is for the best as I wouldn't want to risk giving them anything. I'm worried about work and money, I'm on zero hours agency and my partner maybe being furloughed soon and we are already struggling. I'm angry about the people who aren't listening to the stay in rules and who are just going about things as normal and not caring and seeing friends and family. I think that the country should be put on full lockdown, with no outdoor exercise and strictly only allowed out once a week for food and medicine and that's it. The sooner we lockdown fully and stop these people going out and ignoring the rules, the sooner this virus stops and the sooner life can get back to normal. But the government needs to be firmer with these people not listening or caring. ",8,Anxiety,4,1,7,8,8,3,3,4,"I am still as worried about the situation as I was a year ago. Now the added thing is the Covid vaccine and people having that. I'm not going to get mine until June time probably but even with this I'm not letting my guard down. I'm still missing family that I haven't seen since last year. And I'm still worried about me or my partner getting ill, but hopefully, it will all be fine. The anxiety over it and being around people though is still high and I think will be for some time to come. I will still continue to wear my mask and I don't like being around people not wearing one, if I could avoid people altogether then I really would. "
82,5,Anxiety,1,1,1,6,2,2,4,2,"I feel a bit anxiety but not too much ever since we are locked in at home.

I do enjoy working from home and does not miss waking up early in the morning for my commute to my office.  I am happy to avoid the rush hour every weekdays. 

That said, my weekdays and weekends feels the same and can be a feeling of monotony

I go for my daily jog to the local park which helps me reduce my mental stress and cabin fever.

I also enjoy seeing the local wildlife which makes me less stress and more relaxed ",4,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,2,5,7,5,"I am looking forward to UK reopening of its shops and eventually its bars. I feel confident and have hope that things will get better soon. I am also vaccinate and I am less scare about covid and also feel more confident and content. I look forward to enjoying the things I used to enjoy before covid.

I also look forward to seeing family again. It's been over a year since I seen most of my families.

I look forward to going out and eating out. I also look forward to going on holidays, both in the UK and also to long hual holidays to Asia. "
83,8,Anxiety,4,3,8,9,7,4,4,3,I feel a lot of anxiety about the virus because you just don't know what's going to happen. I miss my family and not knowing how long we'll be apart adds to the anxiety and makes me upset. Even just doing something as simple as popping to the corner shop is a huge stress now because you're constantly thinking about where the virus could be and how easily you could catch it. Seeing the death toll everyday is scary and reading how it hasn't even reached the peak yet is terrifying. It's hard to adjust to this new life of barely being able to go out.,4,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,1,5,6,3,"I'm feeling drained about the situation at the moment because I'm tired of being locked up. I understand the need for it but it's hard, especially mentally. The vaccine being given out at such high rates is making me hopeful but the constant changing of when we're coming out of lockdown is annoying now. The majority of people I speak to feel the same and I can even see the effects it is having on children. I think there's going to be many mental health problems to be addressed once we're out of this being a major emergency."
84,7,Anxiety,5,2,7,9,8,2,4,3,"It just all so stressful. The virus fallout has disrupted my life, I'm out of pocket & have rent arrears. Getting normal supplies/groceries is a near constant frazzling battle. I'm quite worried about how to resolve these problems, especially as I'm unlikely to get a better-paid job now. I live with my disabled mother who's over 60 so that's another cause for concern for me. On a bigger scale, the global death toll is so saddening. The amount of lives & jobs & families & businesses it's disrupted is astonishing. It makes me frustrated, concerned, unhappy, and exasperated in equal measure.",7,Anxiety,2,1,2,5,5,3,4,6,"I really feel a bit happier that things are a bit better than say over the last Christmas period. Consequently, I think that recognisable improvements will be seen with increasing frequency as the vaccines take hold & immunity in the population builds up. That makes me feel more hopeful than I have been since it all started. I don't think we'll be completely free of its effects for a while however, if at all. That makes me feel apprehensive about what problems it could still cause. Additionally, looking back from the current time, the sheer amount of heartache, pain & death Coronavirus has caused makes me feel somehow very frustrated and monumentally sad. I almost can't process just the amount of negativity it makes me feel really."
85,7,Anxiety,3,3,7,8,6,8,8,7,"Right now, I am constantly thinking that I have this disease. Living with health anxiety makes things very raw and drives me up the wall. On the other end of the scale I am happy, and relaxed because I am doing things in the house, that I had been missing, or never had time to do. I have a lot of mental problems and also an eating disorder that I feel could be triggered off with all this. At this moment I am feeling optimistic and ready for the surge ahead, but I am very scared. I think the unknown is a really lonely and sad place and I think that everyone is in the same boat, which does fill me with a sense of power and that we are all going to beat this together. Community was gone and now it is coming back which was missing in our busy lives. A good thing to come from this is that the world can breathe for a moment while we are all stopped in time.",7,Anxiety,4,6,6,7,6,6,4,7,"I have just had my first dose of the vaccine two weeks ago, and my outlook is more of hope now than it was a couple of weeks ago without the vaccine. I can see better days ahead, but I am also disgusted at the amount of people that have died when they didn't need to over how the uk dealt with the situation as a whole. I am anxious for my children and myself on how the world is going to be afterwards and if things will be able to be the same again. I feel that not everyone is going to take the vaccine which means that covid will still be able to spread around those people and mutate in the way we don't want it to, and the vaccine won't be enough it is a scary time still for everyone."
86,9,Anxiety,2,1,9,9,6,1,1,1,"I am worried and so very anxious. I worry about my own health as well as the health of my loved ones. I worry about the economy, both UK and global. I'm scared that my house move will fall through, it matters so much that we move soon, but I also feel guilt that I'm so upset about a house move when people are dying. I worry about my career, I'm on a fixed term contract in academia - what will happen to me now? Will there be a job for me next year? Will my husband still have a job? Maybe we shouldn't move house after all... Mostly I'm just afraid. All the time.",9,Anxiety,6,1,8,9,8,3,2,1,"I'm very anxious. It's been well over a year since I could hug or have any real contact with my young niece and nephews and other family members. Although we now have vaccines, I fear that new mutations will cause a need for further lockdowns. I am not overly concerned about being seriously ill from the virus, I am aged 40 and in good health, but I do worry about suffering from long-Covid as I have chronic fatigue and fear that that could be made worse. I obviously do worry about vulnerable family members too."
87,9,Fear,5,5,9,9,7,3,5,6,"I had only just started to get my life together, and started to do things socially eg, attending lectures, swimming etc. And now that has all been taken away from me. In the sunny weather, I had planned to go to the seaside several times. Again that has been taken away from me. I even lost money on a hotel booking. I will really feel cheated out of this summer. I also feel annoyed, and frightened by people who are in denial, as they still go about their business, as if nothing has happened, potentially spreading the virus. We must all pull together, then the quicker it will be over.",9,Fear,1,9,9,8,7,2,8,1,"I AM WORRIED ABOUT PUTTING MY SELF INTO DANGER. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY LETTING THEIR GUARDS DOWN. I HOPE IT WILL STILL BE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO WEAR A MASK. I WILL BE NERVOUS IF ANYBODY GETS NEAR TO ME, AND DREAD CROWDED PLACES. I HOPE PUBS AND RESTAURANTS WILL STILL HAVE PERSPEX SHIELDS, AND TABLE SERVICE. I AM GLAD, AND RELIEVED WE HAD LOCKDOWN RULES, AND FEEL SAFE WITH THE RULES. THE RULES DID HAVE TO BE PRECISE, BECAUSE EG. THE CHURCH I BELONGED TO, EXPECTED US TO ATTEND, EXPECTING GOD ALONE TO PROTECT US, IF WE PRAYED HARD ENOUGH. WHICH I KNOW IS DANGEROUS THINKING."
88,7,Anxiety,6,4,6,8,5,4,4,2,"The current Corona situation makes me feel apprehensive.  Although some countries are seeing a slow decline in rates of infection and death, there is still a lot of fear in other countries. How the world will change when the infection has passed is also a cause for concern.  There seems to be a lot of misinformation being reported within in the media and it is hard to know which sources to trust.  The government are doing a fairly good job but I feel having the antigen tests available would ease some of the concerns.",4,Sadness,6,2,3,4,7,5,5,5,"At this very moment I feel relieved that an end seems to be in sight for lockdown.  Many people are happy to have the vaccine and feel slightly safer.  I do not approve of the suggestion that vaccine passports should be brought in.  I feel the Corona situation has been overblown for an illness which has a ninety-nine percent survival rate, and worry that this had been at the expense of other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.  The knock-on effect from other illnesses, and a decline in peoples mental health will cause repercussions for some time."
89,6,Sadness,4,5,5,5,8,2,1,2,"I am feeling sad about the social distancing. A relative is ill and at this time, it is obviously not possible to be with her. It is so worrying.
In the past, I have been fortunate enough to work abroad quite a bit, often in less developed countries. I have made a lot of friends around the world and I am worried about how the corona virus will impact them, especially those who are in countries withour a good healthcare system and those who will not get support whilst they are not working. I am also sad as I do not know when and if we will see each other again. I am sad for all who are suffering with coronavirus and for those who have lost people to the virus. ",7,Sadness,4,7,5,8,9,1,2,5,"I am so sad and also angry at how the situation has been mishandled. I am angry that people are catching Covid in the hospitals (this happened to a relative, who then passed away). Sadly many of the health care workers we came into contact with were not trained well and were incompetant.  This is terrible in a country which should not be under-resourced. I am angry that the government has made too many mistakes. I used to work abroad a lot so I feel very restricted but also nervous about things opening up again."
90,8,Anxiety,7,3,7,8,7,5,2,2,"I am anxious for the safety of me and my loved ones. I am angry at my employer for their attitude to staff. They have not been protecting their employees or assisting them in working from home. I am very careful about who I am in contact with at the moment.

I believe that the government have not done enough to protect its citizens in the United Kingdom. The workers in the National Health Service are doing an outstanding job, for which we should all be very grateful.

I don't have anything else to say.",7,Anxiety,6,4,7,8,6,4,5,2,"I am more worried for the safety and welfare of my parents than that of myself, as they are over eighty. For myself, I am just concentrating on not going out and avoiding unnecessary journeys to reduce risk. , until I get my vaccination. I am happy to stay at home, as the risk of catching Covid when out in the community means that it is not worth it. I think that we will not resume 'normal' life until 2022, however, so I don't think that I will holidaying abroad until then. The vaccination take up in this country will hopefully mean that it is safer to stay at home."
91,6,Anxiety,2,1,4,7,6,4,4,3,"Very nervous at the moment, it’s hard to relax and I am just on edge all the time. Even when I wake up with a sore head or something else you are paranoid in case you have caught it. Worrying time’s and pray it’s over soon. I miss doing the normal basic things like visiting friends and family and I feel it has changed my attitude towards life in general. I work in a hospital myself and am worried I pass it onto my wife. I can accept myself catching it but am unsure I could handle seeing my wife catch it because of me. ",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,4,2,7,8,7,Starting to get slightly frustrated with the lack of slackness to the rules as everything seems to be going a lot slower since the vaccines have started. I do feel a lot more positive about it all but it just needs to go a lot faster on opening up the country again. I work in the nhs and I see how drained everyone is so we need that hope that things will start to open again. We just keep hearing the same things all the time and it’s getting to political as well especially in scotland as the snp are trying to always put one over Boris down there which is annoying to me.
92,9,Anxiety,1,1,7,9,4,3,3,1,"I'm finding it a little more bearable than a week ago, because there is not quite so much overload of scary information and situations getting exponentially more dramatic - BUT still preoccupied every minute of the day because of the threat to myself and those I know in my age group. So whereas at the start I was wanting to communicate with friends and family, making sure they were ok and being sensible, now it's the getting through it stage. And that is fairly dull and saddening, thinking of all the things in life one is missing out on, on a beautiful warm day in the country.

But let's be clear, the real anxiety-inducing factor is when the politicians and their advisors look like screwing up. I was completely panicked when they talked glibly about the herd immunity strategy, because it was obviously a mass experiment without informed consent. And every day I try not to watch the 5pm briefing, because the performance of Raab, Whitty, Harris etc makes me even more concerned they are inadequate to deal with a national emergency. And that makes me anxious again. I was quite calm today until I caught a few minutes of their latest performance. Some of those mentioned above would be overpromoted if they were in charge of a bank branch in a small provincial town.",8,Anxiety,1,1,6,8,7,2,3,1,"Well of course I am thankful just to be alive ... but so saddened by the wasted year and the separation from those dearest to me. I detest our government for mismanaging it so grossly and directly causing tens of thousands to die needlessly by choices it was warned against. And I feel sad and anxious that activities that mean the most to me - travel especially - may not be possible for a while, or in similar ways as before.
I feel the virus has found out all the weak spots in our society and in our lives - it's prised open a gap between me and my partner because I respect the rules and she does not.
I feel it has left me like a desert island castaway, living in fairly miserable solitary conditions, but still thankful to be alive. And I do not trust the  vaccines not to be the ship that appears on the horizon and then passes by - not that the vaccines themselves are not wonderful  (they are), but I don't trust our government, or other governments, not to screw up exiting the situation, and set off a third wave of vaccine-resistant variants.
I also have to come to terms with the long-term impact on my aspirations and life choices. I have had to abandon plans to relocate to Europe before Brexit, and have to reorientate to a new situation where work from home may be much more common (the latter is no bad thing, but it's a big readjustment).
In short, I feel I am trapped on plague island, and governed by incompetent charlatans."
93,7,Anxiety,3,6,8,9,7,6,3,5,"I feel a lot of anxiety due to the fact both of my parents are essential workers and are risking their health every day. There is also a man from my church who is seriously ill and I'm praying that he recovers as he has a wife and child. There is so much uncertainty and there are so many people who still aren't taking this seriously so I think this is going to take forever to get over. I miss the freedom of being outside, I miss my friends and I genuinely believe that things are going to get so much worse before they can get better.

I feel slightly hopeful that the government's current plan will work and we'll be able to get back to some sort of normalcy and the death rate will decrease but I feel like people are rushing things and are too ready to do things without precautions like wearing masks or keeping their distance. I feel like it's gotten to a point where the government themselves are ready to put everyone in danger if it means the economy will start moving forward again. I really hope that we're able to move forward from this pandemic but in a way that's sustainable

It feels like the whole pandemic situation is dragging on and on without any real end in sight. I wonder how much longer I will be separated from my family and friends. I was hoping to be able to go on holiday at Easter and now this is not possible. I also very much doubt that we'll be allowed to travel abroad for the summer, which makes me sad."

I am also angry and frustrated at the government's failure to act swiftly where much spread could have been stopped. It tuely feels like that have let it sweep through like wildfire as a stealth attempt at hear immunity. also, the waste and corruption involving massive amounts of public funds makes me despair. The fact the brexit was pushed through during this was insane. it is a relief that vacines are now coming through but I feel that life will not ever return to normal, even if some people are rushing ahead to try."

I keep up to date with the news and it does make me feel a bit anxious, but I think it's essential to know what's happening. I'm not a high risk person but my parents are, so keeping them safe is a priority. It's frustrating having to stay home but it's the only way to curb things while waiting for a vaccine to be developed. I never really left the house much before the lockdown anyway, although now it's enforced, I now have more of a desire to go out. I've been washing my hands a lot more frequently, and also started to use hand moisturiser to keep them from cracking.",7,Anxiety,2,3,2,6,3,6,3,1,"I'm glad that the vaccines are being distributed and cases and deaths seem to be dropping. A little frustrated that I probably won't be offered a vaccine until May or June, depending on uptake. Disappointed that a cruise we had booked for the end of May was finally cancelled, although I knew it was inevitable. Frustrated because I've done nothing for the past year, work-wise, but I finally have a few days of work coming up in a few weeks time. A little anxious because it'll be the first time I've gone into London, and thus on the trains, in over a year and I'm worried about being amongst a lot of people in a small carriage. I've managed to avoid catching Covid so far (or at least, to my knowledge anyway) so I don't want to get it so close to being vaccinated. Just waiting for things to return to a semblance of normalcy. Not entirely normal, but a state where I can go out without worrying about the people around me."

There is stil a way to go yet, but I am hopeful that within about 6 months the world will be mostly back to some sort of normal.  I'm still appauled at the way the government handled it from the start - a great many lives have been lost that could've been easily avoided with proper management of the situation.  I appreciate that it is an unprecedented event recent history, but it is very much an expected event in long-history: humankind encounters pandemics like this every 100-200 years, so we knew it was coming - we had been warned years ago by people like Bill Gates and virologists and generally more globally aware people etc ...at least now we would be better prepared for the next one."

I am missing my family, my friends, swimming, eating out, seeing my colleagues and mooching around charity shops on rainy afternoons. I am also incredibly frustrated by the people I see breaking the rules and acting as though Covid-19 is a joke. I want this to be over, and they get in the way of that."

My daughter will return to college next week so will be at greater risk as travelling on four buses a day plus the mixing with so many people throughout the college day. They have put some safety measures in to try and keep students healthy but still a big worry to me. we already lost one member of extended family to Covid in October of last year. I don't want to lose anybody else or see anyone suffer. It's keeping me awake at night overthinking about all the bad things that could happen to friends and family"

I'm glad that we've started a vaccination program but I think it'll be a long time before things are truly 'normal' again. I'm worried about lockdown ending and the infection rate going back up, I'd like to just stay at home indefinitely. I wish people would stop being selfish and just stay at home to minimise the spread. I'm angry at the government for how poorly they've handled the situation, and wish that they'd looked at how well other countries were doing and followed their lead. "
102,8,Anxiety,7,9,6,9,6,5,4,4,"I am concerned by the level that people are not following the guidelines. I am disgusted by yesterday's events from both Nicola Sturgeon and the ex CMO Catherine Calderwood, this was no mistake this twice blatantly flouting the rules,. Now many people in Scotland thinks it is all a hoax. So am anxious as this will prolong the mess now. It is bad enough getting people to be sensible without the so called medical expert being a complete two weekends in the running especially as i live in Fife just along the road from her so called holiday home. She should be fined not warned, the police messed up, shpws one law for them and one law for us",7,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,2,6,7,6,"Overall I less worried about that Corona than I have been in the past. However I am still anxious in case i catch it. Once I get the vaccination at some point then I will start to feel less anxious. However, I still worry for all the countries who don't have the vaccine. I have friends in other countries who although they have less corona deaths and cases, don't have access to any vaccines, so I worry about them.
Overall I am happy with how the government is handling the pandemic, although my income has been severely cut so can't wait to be able to get back earning a decent amount of money."
103,7,Anxiety,2,1,3,6,1,3,5,1,"It is frustrating not knowing when it will end or when things will get back to normal, or even if they will get back to normal. It's hard to believe it won't change society in a fairly major way, although it's impossible to say how.

At the moment, it feels like everything and everyone is in a state of limbo and only experiencing a half-life.

I would say I currently have a permanent sense of low-level anxiety.

I am also angry that the government has clearly not taken this seriously and, even now, isn't doing the things it needs to, in terms of supplying PPE, testing and respirators in the necessary quantities.",6,Anxiety,1,1,5,5,2,4,5,1,"Things seem to be looking more promising, thanks to the vaccination programme but, with a 3rd wave feared in mainland Europe and schools having reopened here, as well as mutant variants, things could turn bad again.

There's also the fact that few people have received their second dose of the vaccine yet. Until that happens, there still have to be concerns.

Personally, I feel I can make it through this period without getting infected (assuming I've not already had the disease), provided I continue to take sensible precautions."
104,7,Anxiety,6,6,6,7,9,5,5,5,"I have various feelings about this.
1. I am anxious on a personal level because myself and my wife both have health conditions which make us potentially vulnerable to this virus, and so we are doing everything we can to minimize risk.
2. I am also anxious for the country, and the world, as I see health services at full stretch and struggling.  I am also concerned for all those at risk of losing their jobs and livelihoods.
3. I am sad for all those who have lost their lives, and for their families and loved ones.  I am also sad for all those who have lost their jobs and livelihoods or are suffering financial hardship.
5. I am concerned for all those living in countries where available funds and health provision are woefully insefficient to protect the population.
6. I am angry with our Conservative government for cutting back on our health service during the last 10 years, and for failing to prepare for such a pandemic.  As a consequence our NHS is stretched to the limit and the staff are under huger pressure.  I am also angry that the government have failed to provide adequate PPE or testing, placing NHS staff in danger, and exacerbating the spread of the virus.  I am also angry that the government initially had a reckless dangerous strategy to let the virus freely infect the population, which would have killed hundreds of thousands of people.  Even when they changed strategy and began to take measures to control the virus they acted too slowly, again exacerbating the situation and costing lives.",5,Sadness,4,3,5,5,6,6,6,6,"I am sad that so many people have suffered and died from Coronavirus. I am proud of the effort so many people have made in the interestes of the public good.  I am also angry that our government handled it so bacly and condemned tens of thousands of people to death.  I am also a bit anxious about how the government is going to deal with the huge debt incurred, and that the poor will take the brunt of it. But I am also now starting to feel a sense of optimism that, with the vaccine programme going well, that we are close to getting back to some kind of normality soon."
105,8,Anxiety,2,1,7,8,5,2,5,1,"I am anxious about it, particularly as I am a nurse and cannot avoid coming into clost contact with other people (staff and patients) who might be carrying the virus. I am anxious that I might transmit it to my family. I am sad and worried because my elderly father is in a care home and I can't see him and I can hardly bear to think about the possibility of him getting it and dying without his family. I am also angry at the government for not reacting swiftly enough, and for making such huge cuts to the NHS and other public services that it cannot cope with this crisis. ",8,Anxiety,3,3,7,7,6,4,6,1,"I feel very anxious. The government has dealt with covid appallingly badly, not locking down in time, making a total farce of test and trace, causing tens of thousands of people to die unnecessarily. I'm scared that under the strong influence of the tory right, which objects to any kind of restrictions, the government will reopen everything too fast and we'll go into a third wave, and another lockdown. I'm worried about my teenage daughter's mental health. The only thing I feel slightly better about than before is the fact of the vaccine. Other than that, it's all very grim. "
106,8,Anxiety,2,1,6,8,8,1,1,1,"I feel absolute sadness at the way this virus is indiscriminatory. The speed in which it kills is frightening and to see the death toll rise on a daily basis horrifies me. It saddens me that every day people are putting their lives at risk to save others and there is no way of knowing who has it until it is too late.
I wish that people would take it more seriously, that everyone would adhere to the restrictions that have been put in place for our own good, I feel for the medics who are coming into contact with people who have it everyday and for the people who have lost loved ones and never got to say goodbye. It's a truly horrifying - and terrifying - virus,",6,Anxiety,1,1,5,8,6,5,4,2,"I am worried that we are opeining up too soon but at the same time, know that we need to get back to some sort of normality, It still angers me that people are not taking this seriously and that so many people are stull dying and will die. I am worried about my children who are not of an age to be vaccinated, that they will suffer from the talks of the proposed vaccination passports and will miss out. I wish we didn't have the need for them
I'm finding it hard to imagine going back to normal life - will I be anxious about going to a gig, to a football match? Will we forget as soon as things are open that this is how we lived for a year?"
107,8,Anxiety,4,3,7,8,6,4,4,4,I feel concerned for my family’s and friends health and for my health. I am worried about one of us contracting the virus as it does not discriminate and people of all ages are dying. I also feel angry and frustrated that people are defying the Government guidelines and not social distancing. Also found some people to be incredibly selfish as well as people who have been extremely kind to others.  I am an admin worker for the NH and am busy working long hours from home so feel proud that I can contribute to the fight against COVID.,6,Anxiety,1,1,1,5,2,7,5,5,I think there is light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccination programme but wish people would continue to obey social distancing rules in the meantime.  The gradual release of lockdown is a good thing as it gives time for more people to get the vaccination. I feel less worried about catching coronavirus now than I did before as the treatments are better.  I have had my first vaccination but continue to social distance.  I am less concerned about my daughter going back to school now that I know that testing will happen.
108,6,Sadness,2,1,7,3,8,1,5,1,"I feel sad. I feel sorry for those who are treating patients, I feel sorry for those losing loved ones. I'm tired of certain politicians. I'm hoping that when this is all over the NHS will be properly funded and NHS staff properly rewarded. I fear for those in poorer countries.

I feel that those that have been inept at responding to this crisis, Trump I am looking at you, will be punished at the polls. I feel that this will be a massive wake up call to those who care too much about material possessions. I feel that for those who survive this, life will never be the same,",5,Sadness,1,1,2,2,3,3,5,1,I feel weary but at the same time hopeful. I am 52 so my vaccine is only weeks if not days away so I feel that once I have that I will relax a little knowing I will be less likely to be seriously ill if I catch the virus. I feel fortunate as I do not know anyone personally who has died due to the virus but I am horrified when I see the number of people who have lost their lives to it. I feel bored most days yet resigned to abiding by the rules to hopefully keep everyone safe. I feel that by this time next year we should be through the worst and life will be back to normal.

I can't wait to get my vaccination and to see people, do nice things and go on holiday again.

Angry that I'm off work, no money, no idea if I'll have a job at the end of all this, angry at idiots who try to exploit the system, people who selfishly hog all the food.

I've been through the infection and am not scared of getting it anymore. I do appreciate it can be serious for a lot of people, but everyone should be allowed to make their own choices with regards to travelling, going out etc. I am anxious about what will the world look like afterwards and how will we all be affected. I think that our mental health will suffer because of the restrictions, especially the young people's (teenagers especially). I am frustrated and worried most of the time, but right now I just feel tired of it and a bit angry that I'm not allowed to do what I want."

Than there is sadness that people are dying but at the same timeI can;t believe that everything is locked, people are staying at home, no planes no visits nothing and statisticly every year from flu die even more people. I find TV and newspapers fear mongering and I am so worried about people with mental issues because beeing on their own without help and no one to turn to in most needed minutes could involve even more uneccessary death.",5,Relaxation,2,2,1,2,5,9,9,6,"I feel positive, that life will go back to normal again. There is a sadness that it is impossible to visit loved ones who live abroad, as the cost is so high for average income family. I am disappointed that secondary children need to wear masks at school, even the government saying is voluntary and advisory but school don't agree with that option. Feels like there is no choice is the child wants to go back. Suddenly there are no more other illnesses, flu, pneumonia, meningitis is not killing anyone this year as it was before. The common cold is gone as soon as you got sniffle or cough it is a coronavirus. Tests in the workplace, no freedom whatsoever, you either do the test and earn money or starve at home.
It feels wrong to test healthy people without any simptoms. 
before cleaning ears with ear buds was a no, no and now everyone is poking themselves in the nose and their kids twice a week with cotton buds and saying that this is healthy and normal. is it?"

They post photos on Facebook and Instagram going for walks in beaches etc which are say 20 miles from where they live. Yet we are still in lockdown and supposed to be staying local ie the town where we live. We have abided by it even though we live in the middle of nowhere and there are hardly any cases. We have just stayed here for 3 months. We are SO bored. And they are doing the vaccinations so slowly. My daughter is a Vaccinator and there are no shifts for her to work.

I am unable to go and visit my family and everyone is finding it very hard.
I am afraid to leave my house so I am not even taking exercise outside which is very difficult as I am not used to being sedentary and as I live in a first floor apartment, we have no outside space which is especially hard when the weather has been so beautiful.

There are the backlog of operations and treatments that have been postponed due to covid, there are the potential long term illnesses possibly due to covid and there is also the possibility of new variants of coronavirus evading the current vaccines that have been developed to prevent covid.

We are making the best of it by keeping busy, and trying to eat well, but it’s a constant worry there, as I have asthma so may not fade to well.

Seeing the numbers of dead shooting up across the world every day brings me great sadness for those people and their loved ones, and particularly worry that it may also take someone I know.

We are actually quite content at home without thinking of the wider picture, and I feel that we are very lucky. We have enough food and things to keep us entertained, and we all get along very well, so actually spending more time together is very lovely, apart from the low level anxiety whenever we tv ink about what is happening.",6,Anxiety,1,1,1,1,1,6,8,1,"Quite hopeful, but with some anxiety still.  Our cases and death rate are falling significantly, which is great, but we are still in lockdown, which is hard going now.  I am living in an area which is considered a local hotspot, so even though the numbers are coming down nationally, it does feel like my area has some risk attached in everyday activities.

I have had my first dose of vaccine, which helps reduce my anxiety, but I do have some younger family members not vaccinated yet.  Older members of my family have had their vaccines, some both doses, so that really does reduce my anxiety about their health."

I just so worry if i will ever see my family again , but then again a lot of people are probably hfeel how i am , I just wish they would get a vaccine and make us all safe again , this has affeted us all in diffrent ways but as my husband is on a pension at lease our money is not affected",8,Sadness,1,1,8,9,9,3,2,1,"At this moment in time i feel a bit more settled than a year ago i was so so scared then but now not so because i have had my first jab , this makes me feel ever so safer but i know there are no guarantees.
It does worry me if i get ill and there is no room in hospital for me and this worry has blighted my life in the last year , but now there is a little hope i can soon start to see my family again. In the last year and in fact it was on my birthday my husband was diagnosed with cancer and all his hospital stuff carried on as normal but the stress was terrible having to go there so often.We have hope now."

On the good side I'm enjoying a much quieter lifestyle and it's great to see the levels of pollution reducing. I feel calm, relaxed, in love and that the situation is sad for other people more than myself. I ought to say though that it needs to be noted that I don't fear death.

Having had my first dose of the vaccine I'm telling myself not to fall into a false sense of security. I also know that come what may the British people will bounce back although at the same time I feel that the effects of the pandemic will be felt for over a decade.

I am tired of nagging my team about PPE and other trust rules, tired of following those rules myself, weary of all the extra time every simple task takes, weary of trying to reassure patients and families and keep myself and my team safe. My community NHS trust has gone above and beyond to keep us as safe as they can - not all covid patients are in hospital - I cannot fault their efforts, but they can’t knit me any nurses to replace those told to shield or who are isolating or ill or who have retired early because they can’t take the pressure of covid anymore. I am angry at people who think the rules don’t apply to them and mix with friends and family because they are ‘OK’ and they are ‘safe’, angry at a small number of colleagues who claim to be such high risk they must not see covid patients under any circumstances yet have refused to be vaccinated, upset for their colleagues, some equally at risk,  who then have to take more than their fair share of the ‘covid team’ to cover for these fools, but overall I am just very very weary and would walk out of this job tomorrow given the chance. And the budget this week was just a slap in the face and another nail in the coffin. "

I feel that the jobless figures will rise and many firms will not re-open.  I am sure the the uk will comeback from this situation, but I feel life will be different for many people.

Vaccine rollout is going smoothly and soon the vunerable will have some protection against covid.  I think things will be more relaxed this summer, but in the winter months restrictions will have to apply to keep covid under control. I feel hopeful, but cautious regarding the future. As time goes by the scientists will learn a lot more about the virus and how it transmits in certain situations and we all will be able to help protect ourselves by having vaccines every year.

Has anyone thought of the added bill to the NHS for the impending mental health issues this may all cause? It's all just so unknown and the fear of the unknown is the biggest of all. Personally speaking, I feel extremely fortunate to not feel affected though that too may change. My children are thankfully healthy and my parents, too.

On a positive note though, I feel that Rishi Sunak has done an outstanding job in dealing with the situation and cannot praise him enough.

I also feel happy that I get to spend time at home learning my skills.

I am still slightly anxious in case I get it as it can be very serious, and my partner works out of the house 5 days a week in a hospital, so that is slightly worrying.

Overall I feel positive though.

Its made me so bad I am chronically hyperventilating with anxiety, which makes me more anxious :( I just want my life to go back to where it was, as i felt that we were just getting our life on track. I worry that i will lose my work, and end up with no money to pay for our home, our food and that will mean my kids suffer, and i dont want that.",4,Disgust,5,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,"I am frustrated with the procrastination; no one is guaranteed tomorrow and we should just take our chances, I am fed up with the stupidity of the masses, the gullibility and being treated like an idiot by the government et al.

I can cope with my own frustrations but my heart breaks for theirs! ",4,Anger,8,5,3,3,8,2,1,1,"At this moment I am fed up trying to work and be a mum at the same time, from our home.

The government has completely mishandled the situation. This angers me as I feel we could have completely avoided the lock down we are in. I am fearful for the health of myself and my family. I am also angry at people not taking the situation seriously enough and going out the house excessively or for longer periods of exercise than absolutely necessary. They will spread the disease more.,7,Fear,6,7,8,8,6,2,5,1,"I still feel anxious about it as I fear we're not out of the woods yet. A vaccine gives us hope but only on top of other measures. There are still question marks over new variants that make me worry. Life is not going to go back to normal anytime soon, I still feel fearful anytime I go indoors somewhere other than my house, that I am relying on masks to protect me. I can't see that easing soon. I am angry at the government for still not doing enough. The vaccine rollout has been mainly the scientists doing.

I am worried about holidays that are booked - we currently have 3 this year that we must contnue paying for without knowing if we will be able to go or get out money back for them. I am worried about money as i have had my wages reduced and my partner is self employed in construction. This all leads to the worrying about the future of my household. The NHS is doing an amazingly great job but I worry about the strain on them. My anxiety is pretty high at the moment and I hate not being able to go out.

I feel hopeful about the vaccinations. I am slightly angry about how things are as well. I am happy the children are back at school, bit of normality for them, and interaction with other people. I am mostly upset. Other countries have shown excellent displays of leadership and I don't feel like we have had that at all.

I have never lived through anything like this in my lifetime. I miss my friends and family. I am very lucky to have a roof over my head and a garden. I am safe

Have had phone contact with doctors who have said I'm not bad enough to be in hospital yet. I'm terrified of getting worse suddenly or of my children getting ill. The uncertainty of what to expect from the illness is terrifying. I'm also worried about what will happen to us in the longer term if we survive. It's such a frightening and difficult time. Even rich and famous people can't escape it and the best healthcare doesn't seem to mean anything, people still die.

The media are asking questions of MPs that they know they do not have the answers to.",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,1,6,7,3,Feel fairly positive as cases continue to fall and vaccination rates  increase.

A little concerned at returning to school with all the pupils next week.  Concerned that rates of transmission will rise again.  Looking forward to lockdown rules easing and meeting up with friends and family soon.  Happy pressure on the NHS will decline.  Hope to be able to go on holiday in the uk later in the year

I'm at a higher anxiety level than [the current] normal as I have just finished the food shopping. Fear is contagious too. Uncertainty about the future and to what extent and severity of the fall out. Mainly, I feel deceived, even weeks on and we still have no clear idea on numbers of deaths/infections. Also doubt, that all my loved ones will be safe at the end of this, I am already bracing myself for awful news.",7,Anxiety,4,3,3,7,5,3,1,1,"Right now, I am quite angry. Angry at the government for the catastrophic failures which have caused untold suffering. Angry at 'people', I'm the one who gets disgusted looks for distancing around groups of older people gathered on town benches having a good old natter, whilst my husband is shielding. Angry at parents who think it's now OK to gather around the streets after school to have chat, blocking both routes away from the school. Mostly I'm angry at society... not ONCE have I seen examples of patience of others, understanding or a shred of decency, to be honest.

I have lost my faith in humanity. "

I'm not frightened or worried. It will pass. It will be interesting to see how the world reconfigures itself after all this. I hope it doesn't all go back to normal, let's have a new normal with some things at least being different. ",3,Relaxation,2,1,1,1,2,6,8,2,"I feel as if it's been going on for long enough. The UK (and I use that term advisedly) has made a total mess of managing CV19 response and instead of being able to capitalise on our island status we've just drifted from one half-assed lockdown to the next. Too bad. I live in Scotland - NS could have made a much better job of this if she'd been in charge of the UK response and not just Scotland's. Also, sad for all the people who have lost loved ones unnecessarily and the people who are suffering with long covid."

I don't want to catch this and pass it onto my family, anyone can die from this not just the elderly and poorly. I worry about my husband's work because he is by far the bread winner, but I cannot control what is going to happen. I worry about going to the shops and you can never get everything you need, so you end up having to go to several supermarkets several times a week instead of my usual two shops once a week. We are home all the time, we need more food but the shops have placed restrictions on how many of the same items you can purchase. I don't mind staying home for a short period of time to keep us safe, but I'm having to go out every couple of days to get food there by putting my family at risk.

My son goes back to school on the 15th of March, and then things slowly start to get back to normal, haircuts, being able to meet up with family and friends that we have not seen this year is something we are really looking forward to.

I am not anxious for myself, just the fact that I could pass this on to him and others. I also worry for my sister who is on the front line within the NHS and is still awaiting appropriate PPE and to be tested.

I am angry at those who are not following government guidelines. They are prolonging this situation by still going out and not practicing social distancing.
I am stressed bout feeding my family without endangering them by going out. As i am carer for my partner, I have had to isolate with him and our young sons. Otherwise i would bot be able to provide the needed assistance.
I am grateful for my friends support. Without these people we would have run out of food a long time ago. ",9,Anxiety,8,7,9,9,7,3,2,5,"Im afraid that the virus will find its way into my home. My other half is extremely high risk and we have been isolated since 2020 to protect him.

The warning signs from Italy and Spain were plain for all to see. I also don’t entirely believe the figures released from China and suspect the infection rates and overall death toll is far higher than reported. 

Since the lockdown being implemented, it has really frustrated me to see some people still ignoring the rules (gathering in parks, on beaches etc.) but on the whole, the vast majority of the public are complying. I worry about the exit strategy and whether or not there will be another wave of infections before winter. Although research on vaccines has been swift (it’s been fantastic to see the world pulling together on this) it won’t really be able to help for at least 18 months. 

Finally, I’m also extremely worried about the economy and how long the inevitable damage to that will last.

Since lockdown 2.0, daily infection rates and deaths have been falling and it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel. The government has released a plan on how we will leave lockdown which will possibly lead to zero restrictions by June. This feels like a remarkable achievement considering the scale of the problem. However, I do worry about the problem on a global scale, especially how vaccines programs will progress in poorer nations. Corona is the world’s problem. "

The vaccination rollout means families and love ones have the chance to reunite soon which fills me with hope and happiness to be able to see my parents again. I still feel extremely sad over the lives lost and how tragic it has been for so many families.

I must be honest with how annoyed I have been with people breaking the rules, many have continued to see family members throughout the pandemic and feel it’s a little unfair when people have stuck to the rules and missed loved ones so much. I wonder how much of the rule breakers result in more deaths, and tougher lockdowns? 

 I am a positive person and I look forward to the future with much hope and desire to live life a little more freely. Cautiously, but freely. "

The uncertainty around the whole situation is fustrating but i understand the unease around it. It could not have arrived at a worse time to be honest. I am nervous to see how extended family will cope, especially as isolation is very bad for your mental health",4,Anxiety,7,8,6,9,6,4,1,6,"I am extremely exhausted. Seeing different parts of the world open up and resume life is so upsetting. Our government has failed us big time. I just want life to return to normal. Light is ahead, but I am apprehensive but optimistic. There's slight happiness seeing a way out now, but frustration comes into play because people still aren't following the rules (like a lot of people haven't been since the beginning).

I am most worried about my wife who is struggling as she can’t go out and is having to look after 2 small children whilst I’m at work. I am also worried what life will be like afterwards. It all has to be paid for somehow and I can see some astronomical taxes and price hikes coming. Although I have a job for now as I’m a key worker this will cost my employers a lot of money and I’m sure they’ll start looking at redundancies to save cash and I hope I won’t be one of them.,4,Anxiety,2,2,6,8,1,6,2,3,I feel weary of it all. I’ve had enough of the restrictions and all the misery it’s brought. I just want to go out again. I want to get back to my normal life. I do like some aspects. For example I like working from home and want to keep doing this in future. I also like going to the pub without having loads of people crowding round. That’s all I have to say. I can’t think of anything else. There isn’t anything else I can think of about this but I think like everyone else I’m a bit over this. Maybe the prospect of the vaccine is making me lower my guard like everyone else. I’m also hoping we can go away this summer and have some day trips like we used to.

I hope the variants won't be used as an excuse to keep us in a never-ending cycle of lockdowns and reopenings, and having to take new vaccines every six months.

I'm also worried about a number of people that I know that live with mental ill health. They are struggling, really struggling and I do what I can by texting and talking to them.

I'm also very proud of my family. My children are now home from university. One of them is waiting to hear about what is happening with her finals and the other is in his first year.

There are aspects I will take forward such as living in the moment more and making sure I make time for me after this is over which I didn't do much before.   I appreciate things more.

I think there have been such a wide range of lockdown interpretations that have kept this whole thing going longer than it should have done and I just want to to move on now and get my life back. The government have dealt with it the best they could but it’s all been a mess regardless. "
220,7,Anxiety,6,2,7,8,6,3,2,2,Mostly just anxious. Not a lot of people seem to be taking it as seriously as they should be and a lot of people could die before their time due to the neglegence of others. From people on the street to people in the government. NHS workers are being thrown to the lions with basically a stick as protection in regards to safety equipment. If there's one hope it's that this whole thing will make people realise how underfunded the NHS has been all this time and how it's necessary to pump more cash into it.,7,Anxiety,6,4,5,6,5,4,4,3,it's getting better but we're now over a year into this and a lot of things haven't really changed. i understand lockdown is important but it's still difficult to have motivation to do anything when the country is essentially turned off at the mains. Isolation is hard to deal with over a long period of time and things you'd like to do but arent allowed to do is frustrating. I'm very much looking forward to when things get back to normal or close to what once was the norm. I also hope a lot of lessons were learnt from this. I feel like we could have avoided such a long time in lockdown if things were done differently at the start.
221,8,Anxiety,8,8,8,9,8,2,3,3,"I am scared, anxious, worried and very angry at people not taking it seriously.
I am stuck indoors alone with 2 children, this is extremely stressful.
Scared about losing my job and where money is coming from, this makes me upset.
My job is my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""social"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" life, the only time is see other adults. I am so lonely.
My children are angry and do not understand why they cant go to the park when other kids are there. They think I am being mean which also upsets me.
I am tired of not doing anything (I am actually tired). ",5,Anger,8,7,6,6,7,4,3,2,"angry and just plain cheesed off with all of it. Although slightly worried I feel we have wasted over a year. I am angry because I followed the rules yet so many lives were still lost. I am upset that my children lost out education, clubs, holidays, birthdays etc.
I am angry I was forced back to work as a key worker and not once received a thank you.  I am fed up and want to experience some sort of life with my children while they are still children.
I am angry/upset that I have to where a mask (pretty sure I am exempt but not worth the arguments)."
222,5,Anxiety,8,6,6,8,5,5,5,5,"I am concerned about how the UK government is dealing with things.  They do not inspire confidence. They have been slow to respond, have got things wrong, didn't take it seriously early enough, etc. I have no confidence in them.  I'm quite enjoying lockdown though as I have so much more time and have been able to jobs around the house and the garden which is nice. I feel more in control at home, but am concerned when I venture out because other people are more unpredicable and the government hasn't locked down enough so the disease is still spreading.",5,Anger,7,6,6,6,7,5,5,5,"I am very annoyed with the government for doing so little to protect us.  Even the vaccination programme which could have been a positive was turned negative by using it as an experimental tool and moving the goal posts for some after they had had their first vaccination.  I'm fed up of the restrictions, but see that they are necessary generally.  I do think it should have been a stronger lockdown so it could have been shorter - too many going to work.  Schools are going back too early with no real measures in place to stop spread of aerosol.  I feel anxious because I am still waiting for my jab and my son is back at school with hundreds of kids from Monday.  He will be on public transport too.  If they had waited till the end of the month it would have made a big difference to me."

I'm worried that we'll soon be told we can't go out to exercise, as that's the thing making me feel normal at the moment. I'm still slightly worried and anxious about the health of my family members (if they were to catch the virus), although I'm less worried that they'll catch it than I was a week or two ago. I'm sad I probably won't be able to go on holiday this year.",2,Sadness,1,1,1,4,6,2,5,1,"I'm tired of the Covid situation now. We need to start getting back to normal and reopening shops and businesses. The most vulnerable people have already been vaccinated, and everyone else will be vaccinated soon, so it's time to get life back to normal.

I also feel angry that the government has not done more to support the people that need it during the pandemic. I also feel a strong longing and desire to finally do normal things again like seeing/visiting friends and family once covid-19 restrictions are lifted. I want to return to normality without having the constant worry of covid.

I have nothing else to say. But I'm not hitting 500 characters so cannot proceed. Therefore there will not be any useful information below this. Not sure what else I can add.

I worry about my relatives too - my sister is reluctant to have the vaccine unless it can be completed in the initially recommended period of 3 weeks."

I don' really like phone calls and prefer face-to-face communications, so it is hard in that respect. I feel a little anxious as to how long this will go on for. I also worry about whether my parents will get ill. It's also hard not having things to look forward to, as you can't plan anything at the moment. I do like having a bit more time to myself (when my son and husband let me!) but I'm also working full time from home so that means I don't have limitless time. ",6,Anxiety,6,3,4,8,6,6,3,1,I am just feeling fed up with it all. I just want everyone to be vaccinated and for things to get back to some semblance of normality. I am also angry at the ineptitude of our government for allowing so many to die and for not giving nurses the pay rise they deserve. They have been an utter shambles; it is embarrassing. The only positives in all this are that people discovered it is possible to work from home if they so wish to do so after this; some people have found great ways to relax; we have a much better appreciation of teachers; and that science and vaccines are still things the UK does well.

I am worried in case any of my close family, especially my children or my grandparents, get Covid-19 and what that could mean for us. This would somewhat change how I currently feel about the situation. Although things are bad in general, for my family here we have it relatively good.",6,Anxiety,1,1,2,4,2,6,6,3,"I'm glad that things are improving. I am a bit anxious that I have not had a vaccine yet, and that something bad could still happen and I could get it before the vaccine comes.

I am quite sure that some worse disease will come along, whether a coronavirus variant or something new, and another frightening pandemic will be upon us then, probably one much more scary and deadly. The most disturbing part is that while we can prepare the practicalities like PPE and organisational work, we can't prepare for the unknown, the illness itself. And some people have been incredibly selfish and never even cared about minimising the transmission of this disease so they'll probably be just as cavalier next time."

If there was some plan that the public were aware of then this would ease my anxiety but at present the government are not giving anything away in terms of what the next steps might be.

I do also feel a little anxiety in catching the virus itself as the supermarkets are busy and its very difficult to keep socially distance.
I do feel this  anxiety has lessened in the recent days due to being proactive with finding alternative business ventures and looking at a more long term view instead of just the next month or so.

Until he is vaccinated we are going to be vulnerable. I have been in a full 13 months next week and it seems that the government are not really protecting people like me who have other people in the house having to work.

It is shocking to see that at least 1/3 of the people I interact with (due to my job) dont believe in Covid and dont do anything to prevent themselves and/or other to catch it or transmit it. This is extremely annoying for me and due to that I very often feel moody and angry throughout my day. At the same time, knowing that my family is in a different country makes me less worried about them and how my job can affect their health; however the fact that I have managed to send a whole year not (knowingly/ tested)tested positive for covid and I have followed all necessary rules in order to do so, makes me extremely angry to see people responding so carelessly about it and being the reason why we are heading back to normality so slowly."

I really don't know what will happen next I feel scared as the death toll Rises each day I worry for my family and friends

Because of them, the whole society might get punished, even though most people are staying at home and not gathering outside.

I am scared of the daily numbers. I am scared to leave the house. I am fearful of what the future holds, and what will be left standing when we leave the house. I miss my family and friends. I miss being able to leave the house to go into town for coffee, to eat out, to socialise, to shop etc... I am anxious when I see other people and not to go too close to them.",9,Anxiety,1,1,6,7,2,7,5,2,"I am still very scared of Corona and what it means for our future. I have now had both my vaccines but I don't think this is a fast ticket out of this. I am less worried about the safety of my family and friends as we have had a lot of doses of vaccine, but have anxiety that Corona could mutate further and there will be a strain that comes along that knocks us all for six. I am happy it is Spring and the sun is out, that gives hope. The winter has been bleak and depressing under lockdown, now we have sunshine everything feels a bit better."
296,4,Sadness,4,4,2,2,7,6,5,4,"I actually feel very curious.
I am obsessed with the statistics and the numbers. I can't help but think about how/why no one saw this coming and how come no country was prepared for something like this. How come the economy is so fragile, and how come people are not really following the rules set in place by the government.
I am also curious to know how life will resume after all this. What will change? What will stay the same.
So above all, I am curious. Curious to know more about the disease and its effects.",4,Desire,3,3,3,4,3,5,4,7,I am ready for the lockdown to be over. I am longing and looking forward to going out again. Having to stay home out of compulsion is a bit stressful and I think it is beginning to have adverse effects on our bodies and our minds. A lot of my friends are now seeking yoga classes especially because of back pain from sitting down for long hours in front of a computer doing meetings and using the internet. I also think creativity is being killed by having to stay at home with little or no interaction with other people from work or even friends.

I am anxious about it if I think too much about it, I'm worried as my partner is a paramedic and I worry about him. I worry about my mum getting or someone I love getting sick with it. It's not nice being outside as everyone looks at you with distrust and fear but I miss going out and seeing friends and family and living my life. I do like having more time at home and not travelling through London so much and I also like having more time with my daughter and my partner. But overall its a very scary and worrying time.",3,Sadness,4,3,2,4,8,4,3,3,"I'm just fed up of it, I'm sick of not being able to go anywhere or see my family and friends. I just want things to go back to normal and a clear plan for when things will go back to normal. I think the vaccine roll out has been great, now let us live our lives again. So many people have suffered in different ways from the virus from losing their jobs, not being able to see other people, I've had enough of it. Its also really hard to plan anything as before Christmas the rules changes pretty quickly and we couldn't see our family that was the last straw."
298,6,Anxiety,3,1,6,7,7,1,6,1,"I feel anxious as the numbers keep rising ..it makes you worry about if you do catch it because even though got no underlying health problems , younger people do still die. I am hoping the deaths start to go down now because there was a decrease today and it's been 2 weeks since lockdown so hopefully will start to see the effects of that. I'm scared to go to supermarket but know I have to as here are no online delivery slots . And I appreciate these are for vulnerable and I can get to the shop, but it's made us all so scared and have to disinfect all the packaging when get home because loads of people would have touched the items. Also become anxious about cleaning and disinfecting the house every day even though not been out. On a plus note, it has made everyone just slow down which I think is great. It makes us all realise all the money we spend on stuff we dont need and we have time now to sort stuff out in the house, read a book etc. But I miss being able to go for  a picnic or drive to a nice place for a walk ",5,Sadness,5,2,5,5,7,2,3,2,I just feel so resigned. Schools go back next week after iver 2 months off and hopefully locjdoen ended by June but it all seems pointless now. I've lost touch with all my family and friends and relationships will not be the same now. I feel lonely but almost like I don't want this to change as got so used to being at home. I think people will just be wary if being around people for a long time. I feel anger at people who have flouted rules when a lot of us have followed the rules. I feel upset that people will continue to be worried even after it has all calmed doen a lot....it just feels like the world has changed.
299,7,Anxiety,4,4,6,8,6,4,5,3,"I have a feeling of fear for not knowing what is to come
In the next few weeks.  I also have frustration because of the people who are not following the lockdown guidelines.   I have a great deal of anxiety about catching covid19 as I live with nhs frontline workers I don’t want to be the one that makes them have to stay at home and not work. I hate having to go to the supermarket for essentials as this means having to be in close proximity of other people. I miss being able to go out for walks and to the shops ",6,Anxiety,3,2,6,8,6,4,3,4,Corona makes me feel sad for all the people who have lost their lives.  It makes me angry that not everyone follows the guidelines which results in everybody having to suffer with lockdowns.  I worry about my family and work colleagues getting it and having to suffer.  The anxiety about working with little children is hard not knowing if they are carrying it and I can catch it.  Hopefully with the vaccine better days will come and a light may well be at the end of the tunnel.

There are numerous things to feel anxious about. Firstly, hearing a lot about the the death toll in the UK and who has the virus from social media and the news has made me feel anxious. Not only this, but the worry of my current job at the moment i.e. will redundancies be made if this goes on for the rest of the year.  I think my biggest worry is that no one at this time knows how long this will go on for. ",5,Anxiety,5,4,5,8,6,3,4,2,"I feel anxious. There is a promise of relaxing the rules in the summer, this is too soon. We have all been accustomed to social distancing, washing our hands and wearing masks for a year and i feel it is going to take time for me to get back to normal. As we gradually open more and more things to normal I think I’m going to find it really difficult to be in crowds of people. I also am going to anxious about returning to the office, as I work in shared building with multiple companies and I’m not sure if they will have the same safety standards as my company. I think I will have to ease myself back into it, maybe starting off by meeting my family for a walk and eventually reaching a phase where I’m comfortable having friends over to my house for a garden party.

I work in a food shop and therefore still come into contact with a lot of people and I live with my parents who each have their own health issues, so I am worried about the possibility of taking home the virus to them.

I'm anxious about the vaccines as I worry that they haven't had long enough to be tested properly and also that people seem to think it's a miracle cure and they can carry on as normal once they've had it, when this simply isn't the case. I'm also a little angry that some people don't seem to treat the situation seriously and don't follow guidelines and are therefore putting other people at risk"

But personally, I am not that worried as I am following the guidelines. Making sure to stay productive and active as well which has helped with my mental/physical health. It was a bit stressful at the start of the lockdown (UK) but I have gotten used to it at this point. Can't wait for it to end though as some proper fresh air and outdoor activities would be nice especially with the warm weather. I'm slightly optimistic that we will all behave differently after this all ends as well. Maybe start paying health care and other essential workers properly and treating them well too.",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,5,8,3,"At this moment, I am pretty relaxed because it feels like a lot of things are going well (vaccines, lockdown relaxation etc.). I am looking forward to the rest of the year and hopefully eventually being able to go on a holiday once this is all finished. This will probably require me getting a vaccine so slightly nervous about when I will be able to get this and whether there will be a chance to get this before Summer ends due to my age range.

I am currently trying to get my mind straight so I can focus more on the work I have to do as I have my dissertation due as well as summer exams where even though they won't effect my grade if I do bad, I still want to do well in these. Hopefully this will only last a few weeks this lockdown as I miss spending time with my friends as I am a very social  person",2,Anxiety,2,2,4,6,4,6,5,4,I am very optimistic due to the vaccine rollout. Its been a very hard year but its positive we can see the end and hopefully this means that summer we can enjoy a stressed free period where everyone is enjoying life. I just hope that people stick to rules and not be stupid when restrictions start loosening up as I know that some people can be a bit stupid and think its an opportunity to hold parties etc. I know i wish this wont happen but there will be people who will do this and that frustrates me extreamly.
304,7,Anxiety,2,2,6,6,4,4,4,2,"I feel worried about the Corona situation. Our prime minister is currently in intensive care, and I fear for my elderly parents. I am dreading the prospect of months under lockdown. I am also concerned about the long-term impact on the economy - of my favourite shops closing - and the likelihood of austerity politics returning. I am concerned about the welfare of my family and friends, and whether or not they may be made redundant.
I am working from home but don't particularly like this arrangement, and worry about the vulnerable patients that I work with.",7,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,4,"I feel a constant low-level anxiety about the situation, and how quickly it can change. Mainly I feel fatigued; missing my family and wanting to normal things (visit friends who have had babies/become engaged during lockdown; go to the pub). I feel great sympathy for people who have lost loved ones, or their jobs. 

The progress of the vaccine roll-out gives me some hope, but it feels like every day there is a new story about variants, or people not wanting to take the vaccine, and it feels that the situation won't end. I worry mainly about my parents' health."
305,8,Fear,7,6,9,9,9,2,3,3,"It is a very worrying time, as there are many shortages in shops and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get essential items. It’s also very concerning how rapidly the number of cases and number of people dying from coronavirus each day is increasing, despite being under lockdown. I hope that tougher measures can help to get the situation under control, in order to help protect those most vulnerable. It is also worrying that frontline workers have not got the essential equipment needed to look after those suffering, as they are risking themselves to help save lives, which I hope can be improved soon.",4,Anger,8,6,3,2,7,2,1,7,"I currently feel quite disappointed, particularly towards how the government have handled the situation. It's so frustrating seeing other countries handle this better, but also annoying to see people continue to break lockdown restrictions, as we're all longing to go out and see our friends! Its overall a difficult time, but I'm hopeful we can return to normal soon. Although it seems a long way away, with the lockdown roadmap in sight, hopefully the government has finally got it right, especially due to the success of the vaccine in the UK."

I am really dissatisfied at the game being played by crooked politicians as Mr Trump refers to them - here in the uk with snail pace response. I was alot more cavalier to start with but got apprehensive as i experienced it myself . i am relaxed and axious for others. I am really agry at the rip off price gouging merchants - i am in business this is a time to support the people not rip them off.,7,Anger,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,"I feel very frustrated with the situation surrounding coronavirus. the response of our folks in charge has been very erratic at best. As a self employed person I feel left out of the financial packages and its like the serf or a captive on a slave ship. There is no real end in sight; the frustration of impeding real life is aggravating. The lockdown provided a bit of an earthing but its prolongation is far from logical. I appreciate what has been done, compared to other countries, but these measures at best are favourable to only some special friends and segments of society whilst 5 million plus like myself self employed have been left on the cess pit pile. This is a really crude practical joke by the folks who are running the response. It is now a new shambles with vaccinations - are we going to all get a yellow book next - no book, no access to daily life ? I belived the herd immunity but where is it - what was that all about - if one is immune why the requirement for vaccine - what spectrum are the vaccines - will we need another one in september again? When can I get on with daily life and like a normal person ? The fact a vape shop is considered essential but a clothes shop is considered non-essential ; I met an old pensioner struggling for shoes in town centre - he had the money cant use the internet and needs a new pair of shoes in the winter rain. that sums it up for me - absolute chaos and illogical. I accept the science and still the explanations contradict science. I accept the coronavirus is real and its potential harm, but what i do not understand is how certain people are getting better deal from the folks in charge - feels like we are in a medieval time. feel frustrated and my patriotic side is totally embarrassed my country (uk) is now an international laughing stock now, like a Mr Bean film. its really frustrating 1 year in what was supposed to be 6 weeks maximum and gone by the summer."

I am feeling a little uneasy about money, although right now I feel like I have enough to get me through the next few weeks.

I don’t feel scared or worried for myself or my health but I do feel worried for other people, mainly older relatives and friends. 

I dislike the uncertainty of not knowing when things will begin to get back to normal. I feel there is a lack of information from those in charge and this leads me to believe that they don’t know either ",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,2,6,7,4,"    I feel like the corona situation is getting better.
    Several people I know have received the vaccine, which is a relief, and in my area we can get the 30 minute test whenever we want.                            
    Also with the road map in place it has become easier to look forward and plan ahead. I’m looking forward to socialising with family and friends that I’ve not seen over this year, as well as camping and festivals.

I am slightly stressed out in the current situation due to the limiting effect that it has had on my daily routine but i am also enjoying the time i have at home with my family memebers.",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,1,3,7,2,At this very moment i am currently hopeful about the pandemic nearing a point in which life can be allowed to return to somewhat normal. I am excited to see venues and other locations scheduled for reopening. I am also glad to see that the majority of the vulnerable people through the UK are being vaccinated and are much safer to the more dangerous side effects of corona virus. In terms of the virus itself i am no longer worried for my loved ones as they are much more protected from the virus or have already had the strength to pull through having the virus.

My kids are out of school and need things as a result of that. I'm stressed but trying my best to make sure we have everything we need.

I am stressed that I am unable to get online groceries deliveries yet I am supposed to remain at home for 12 weeks due to being high risk, yet when I go to the supermarket, they are constantly sold out of essential items such as toilet roll and pasta. Panic buying is selfish and unnecessary and is detrimental to those of us who are unable to stock up for various reasons,  Social distancing is not being followed strictly enough in the UK compared to other countries such as Dubai. ",8,Anxiety,1,1,2,6,3,3,3,1,"I am frustrated that we are still in this situation. I am fed up working from home and having too much time on my own.  Not seeing my work team can be challenging waiting on people to action things. I am annoyed that people still break the government's restrictions which are in place to protect the NHS and keep people safe. However, I am looking forward to being able to see family and friends both in my local area and further afield. Being restricted for so long allows me to value my freedom a lot more. "

I am making the most of the time I spend at home rearranging things with the time I have in my hands I am able to review things and working from home is great as working instead of taking time off so will have enough time off for the summer school holidays. This time away has given me time to do the things I enjoy, going through each day as it comes one day at a time. It was a bit much doing the home schooling for 2 weeks but it was rather draining doing that and working too as that was tiring and I didn't get to do some reading as I would usually do during my commute to work and home on the weekdays.",4,Relaxation,4,1,2,2,1,9,8,6,I feel a lot more relieved now than I did a year before especially with the vaccine and employers allowing staff to work from home. A lot more relaxed since schools open tomorrow so less pressure to home school and so that’s one more load off my mind. It’s been interesting to see how women have borne most of the pressure during this pandemic and now with IWD looming there’s the challenge to change include more women in leadership roles to help make policies that are favourable to all including women.
312,6,Anxiety,7,6,3,6,4,7,4,4,"I am quite calm about it , but mostly annoyed at the government and how they are not dealing  with it. I am unsure if the main stream media are helping, and the hypocrisy towards the nhs from the media and government  is galling. Hopefully the social isolating will work, but we will not get back the 3 weeks lead we wasted.
Hopefully we will follow Italy's lead in a bit, but there is no real structure for an exit strategy to the voluntary lockdown.
There is a possibility that there will be a bounce when that happens if it is not handled correctly ",6,Anxiety,4,1,4,4,1,4,2,1,"I feel we are turning a corner and if people  can just manage not to screw  it up long enough to vaccinate everybody we can get back to normal. The government have handled this abysmally , luckily private companies have boxed off and created vaccines a d the nhs have dealt with the vaccination. The next step should be getting our money back for the failed test and trace and prosecuting those involved in the cronyism and ppe scandal.

My partner is very frustrated that she can't get out and about but is accutely aware that it's stupid to be out there and socialising or breaking the rules.  We are all adhering strictly to the government guidelines and are looking to do what's necessary.  
Personally, I miss the team and sporting activities that I would like to have been doing.

Normal life feels a long way off and I would not be comfortable with it until I have been vaccinated and the rates are lower.

The uncertainty is very upsetting and causes me anxiety to an extent.

I hope this is only temporary and now with the vaccine hopefully things will improve and life will go back to normal.
320,7,Anxiety,1,1,4,7,2,5,3,2,"Mainly, I feel worried at the moment.  Worried about how long the outbreak will last, and the associated health risks for myself,  my family and friends.  Also i am worried about the economy and personally,  my own job security.  The longer this situation continues,  the more worrying it is, as I think the economic impact will take longer to recover from. For example,  it it continues for the next three to six months, I think that it will take the country and the economy at least as long again to fully recover from it. ",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,7,8,5,I feel optimistic about the coronavirus situation at the moment.   Things are starting to improve and the news coverage about coronavirus recently has been optimistic as well.  I am very hopeful that this is nearing the end of the coronavirus pandemic.  Hopefully things will start to return to normal over the next few months.  It has been a long year dealing with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on day to day life so i will be very grateful when the situation is finally over.  I am looking forward to going about my day to day activities without having to think about coronavirus any more.
321,3,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,1,8,8,6,"While it is weird the my life is 'on hold' I was too busy before, and am grateful for some time out. I am enjoying being with my immediate family, being able to relax, read, sit in the garden. I am learning new skills/hobbies (crochet, sourdough). I recognise that I am privileged because I do not need to worry about our financial situation, we have enough food, and no-one in my immediate family is ill.
In general I am not anxious about the virus. I understand that statistically speaking, I will get the virus, but will survive. I also understand that I am not a statistic!
As a Christian I feel as safe now as I ever did, knowing that God is in control, both of the global situation and indeed of my own personal one. ",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,3,6,6,4,"I am frustrated that lockdown continues even though cases have dropped so low. I feel we are risking the lives of younger people who are missing cancer screenings etc, and I know of several people who have committed suicide because of the current situation. 
Somehow government is no longer taking off a trade off between lives, it’s all about saving the elderly and vulnerable. But they have had their vaccines by now!
We should reopen the country and get the economy working again as soon as we can. It’s not a case of money vs. lives, the economy is lives. 
Also our children have missed out on so on much of their youth and their education. "
322,6,Anxiety,5,7,6,7,7,4,3,7,I am currently working from home so know that I am in a privileged position financially but it is really tough not having physical contact with my colleagues. I am starting To get angry about the people who are not taking the restrictions in place seriously as in the long term it will not do the country any favours in fighting this virus. I am also starting to feel anxious when going out as I am concerned that I will pick up the virus and spread it to my loved ones in the household who are classed as vulnerable.,2,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,5,7,3,Neutral on feelings tbh I don’t feel at risk because I have followed the rules strictly. I am confident once vaccinated it will be over soon. I have missed seeing my family and my nieces and nephews. We have moved home since the pandemic so also looking forward to exploring the area. I have more hope for future than sorrow at this moment in time. I think we will end up living with this like we do fly and other diseases. The hardest thing has been the increase in food costs and although I have stayed in full time work my partners wage has dropped and even affording one shop a month is difficult with the price of food. Fruit and veg is cheap but everything else seems to have shot up in price.
323,7,Anxiety,2,1,8,8,6,4,1,3,I feel very worried about the Corona situation at the moment. I feel very restless and can't settle to do anything or concentrate on watching anything as my anxiety is quite high. I have heard that up to 80% of the population will be infected so there is a good chance I will get it and not only the old and weak are the ones dying so it seems like a bit of a lottery as to who will survive and who will not. I miss visiting my family and friends although i do have family living with me so I am not completely alone.,3,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,4,5,8,2,I am willing to follow the rules and stop the spread etc but i'm tired of the whole situation. I just want it to be done with already. I am hopeful that the vaccine will help us to deliver herd immunity and that life can begin to feel normal again. Children need to be back in school not just for their education but also for the important socialisation which they are missing out on. I also feel slightly conned by this survey as 500 words is not really just a few sentences is it? I have uni assignments that are set at 500 words its more of an essay than a few sentences to be honest.
324,5,Anxiety,2,2,5,7,2,1,1,1,"I feel worried that a cure won’t be found, I feel anxious about getting it or passing it to my children. I’m worried for the economy and how the country will cope if this carries on any longer. I am worried that there will be riots at some point. Every one seem to be turning on each other, and grocery stores are becoming like a battle ground. Everyone is on edge and snappy and I really don’t like where this country is headed. I have been at home with my children because all schools have shut down. I haven’t seen my family in over a month now, my children’s lives are being changed so drastically and I don’t know how much longer we can manage financially. ",8,Anxiety,7,5,7,9,5,1,1,2,"I am so frustrated and annoyed with the coronavirus restrictions now, I feel trapped and I hate it. I can’t live like this for much longer. It’s affecting my mental and physical health. My neighbours are being really intimidating and I am scared being trapped here with no escape is just unbearable.  As soon as the restrictions have eased I will be going to see my family. Going to the beach and having fun, instead of stepping on eggshells and feeling unsafe in my own home. Boris Johnson has absolutely no idea on how the poorer or working class live, and before I was in this situation myself I had no idea how hard life is when you have less money and support to get the security and safety that a person needs in life. I feel like I don’t have the basic human rights that I should be entitled too, just because I have less money than other people. My husband works full time and I am a stay at home parent, and we are struggling financially because of the current climate. "

I think everybody would have the same feelings.

I feel that we need to play our part in order to make a safe environment for everyone, atleast that's what we can. I don't see life coming back to normal soon.

I have anxiety about my grandmother  staying healthy and I am sad about not being able to see her and I am also very sad about not seeing my five year old nephew who I am very close to. I am also very worried about my dad as he has asthma and in the past had pneumonia so I am anxious about him. I am thankful to all the doctors, nurses and shop workers, school workers, everyone on the front line who has gone to work every day and looked after the country."

I also haven't left the house in over 2 weeks now, and struggling to get a grocery shopping slot, and am worrying how I am going to get my groceries as I don't drive nor have anyone to help, so it is scary. I also do not like the uncertainty of the situation, as no one knows when we will be out of lockdown nor when we will be back at school, as I am doing a placement in a school and I was near the end of my course, so I may not even be going back to the school, which sucks.",7,Sadness,4,4,8,9,7,2,2,2,"I am feeling so fed up with corona. I feel like it is never going to end. I haven't seen my family since 2019 and it is just hard. I wish life would return to normal as it has affected my mental health significantly. It is a very scary Time because my family members who I haven't been able to see have had the illness too and it is hard. It is hard on my daughter as she misses school tremendously and she is only 4 so doesn't understand and she also has special needs so she is struggling even more with her learning, and not being at school has made her even more behind"

Feel concerned how long this will go on for - can’t go on forever and feel nervous about staying in the house all the time (although am doing so). Worried about income as that has dropped for me so added worry about how long we will be in lockdown. Feel angry that people aren’t sticking with the lockdown and could mean we can’t go out for exercise
Every time you get a sore throat or anything you feel worried in case it’s Coronavirus ",4,Anxiety,1,1,1,4,1,4,5,2,"At the moment I’m feeling nervous about coming out of lockdown. Like others I have got used to working from home and not going out and need to get used to going out again which makes me anxious.
I also feel relieved that vaccines are being rolled out, family members have been vaccinated. The number of cases and deaths are going down which is promising. Shows that there might be light at the end of the tunnel and the end in sight.
It also makes me nervous if we need to have another lockdown in future. I think like a lot of people each lockdown is harder to do- the current one was the hardest! Especially in January when it’s dark all the time  "
329,1,Anger,5,5,1,2,1,4,3,3,It makes me angry that the media is feeding lies into society to drive fear. It is disgusting how many people are happy to submit to a state enforced home incarceration regime. It is easy to fool people but difficult to convince them they are being fooled. One day they will realise the truth but by then it will be too late. Keeping people under house arrest will not stop the spread of the so called virus. The level of imposed control and over reach of powers by the police is draconian and extreme.,1,Anger,8,6,4,5,6,1,1,2,"I feel the risk is over exaggerated, there is no real threat, but they keep coming up with new variants to keep us locked in our homes. The consideration of vaccine passports sickens me, this is a level of authoritarianism not seen since second world war Germany. I will not willingly take the vaccine for an illness which has an almost one hundred per cent survival rate. The way people have just accepted their own enslavement makes me weep for humanity. I will continue to live my life without fear as best I can but they are making it increasingly more difficult to be an independent individual with critical thought. I dread to think of the world that all the babies are coming into, they will suffer the most."

I am missing my friends and family and feel anxious when I think about the fact I don’t know when I will be able to see them again. I have to go to the doctors for blood tests because of my underlying medical issues and had a panic attack actually leaving the house properly for the first time. Looking out of the window everything looks great and then suddenly you remember that things just aren’t what you are expecting them to be, and it’s terrifying that you just don’t know what is coming next.

Because I live in such a small village I’m more confident in how I can live safely around here, just hard that I don’t really know when I’m allowed out again! I am ready just to be able to see my family again, thankful to be able to bubble and have the support of friends that I didn’t have at the beginning of lockdown one so I don’t feel as lonely as I did then, glad to have friends and a community to support me.

Uncomfortable re whether or not the correct message is getting through to people.

Unsure about the way forward and not confident that we will get through this soon.  the way that the U K government is dealing with this does not inspire me with confidence and I don't like the fact that the Scottish government is unable to make ALL the decisions themself for the Scottish people.

We have lost people but also saved people from not having flu this year. The impact on mental health now is very concerning and we are wasting time that we should have with our families and friends. The government have done the best they can and people need to stop judging. We are all in this together and i feel that has been forgotten. We aren't able to move on unless the media let us. As a single full time working mum i need my life to start again and am fed up of being lonely and tired.

Looking forward to travelling again and taking trips with my partner to parts of the world we have not yet seen or discovered. Even just going on nights out for a meal and to the pub or socialising with friends and family.

Having to post presents instead of giving them to those celebrating in person.,5,Anxiety,4,2,6,7,6,5,5,6,I feel scared that the virus is going to go on a lot longer yet possibly until at least the end of this year. I am really Worried about mine and my partners job security & if we will ever get to travel again. The new variants seem to be more of a threat at the moment especially in Europe which is very scary and concerning. It just seems like a nightmare which is never ending & that is still affecting a large part of the world. Although you hear little about some other countries in the news now which you heard a lot about at the start of the pandemic. The vaccine shortages and the arguements over the supply of the vaccine with Europe is also scary & could affect the effectiveness of the vaccine.

I am looking at other countries data from around the world and things are starting to look more positive from Italy and Spain, where hopefully the figures have peaked as they continue to ‘flatten the curve’.

It makes me angry to see people disobeying the rules and advice set by the government and causing more damage to the country and putting a lot of strain on the NHS.,9,Sadness,1,1,3,5,9,1,1,1,"I feel sad at how many people have lost their lives through this pandemic, how many people are struggling to go about their daily lives due to the restrictions set in place and how many people are struggling financially because of it. I'm even more worried now that due to the Job Retention Scheme and the Furlough Scheme, we are in a huge debt which will lead to a financial crisis very soon and we as the people of this country, especially the working people will be affected badly by it, having to pay more tax in order to cover up for the government."
345,6,Sadness,2,1,4,5,8,1,2,1,I feel sad and lonely to be honest. Everything within my life has changed; I’m adapting to working from home which isn’t easy - I miss the little things like laughing with colleagues on a daily basis or simply being able to walk to and from work everyday. When it gets to the weekend the prospect of not being able to do anything is upsetting. I’ve wanted to try and do something productive during my down time but can’t draw myself to motivate myself to do anything effective. This makes me feel worse even still and fees like I’m wasting some of the time to an extent.,4,Sadness,6,3,2,4,7,2,2,1,"I feel sad that it feels it has gone on for so long when compared to other countries successfully managing the pandemic more successfully than us. I feel sad for the people that have lost their lives and those that are going to be heavily impacted by a future economic downturn as a result of the pandemic and those who have already lost their jobs. Loneliness is also something I’ve been feeling more and more, I feel that maintaining friendships is harder and not being able to see family is frustrating. I do feel lucky though that I’ve been able to stay employed and haven’t been impacted by the virus and neither have my family. "
346,6,Anxiety,1,1,1,2,1,1,6,4,"Global disaster that doesn’t affect you until it does. I don’t know anyone who has had or has it, yet it clearly affects a lot of people. I’m looking forward to life getting back to normal as it’s difficult juggling working from home and raising my child. I mostly just feel tired and lethargic, staying indoors is energy sapping. I worry about myself getting it, mainly because I don’t want to be fully quarantined for two weeks. Throughout it all I have to wonder how this thing really started, and how long it’s really been around for.",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,"I feel that we are through the worst of it and there’s some light at the of the tunnel. Once the majority of the population have been vaccinated we should be able to get back to normal. Hopefully by the summer we should be able to live our normal lives again, going on holiday and not having to wear masks all the time. As soon as masks aren’t compulsory I never want to wear one ever again. We just have to wait and hope that the vaccine works and we can live with this like we live with the flu. Hopefully the world will return to normal and there won’t be any silly little rules imposed on us."
347,2,Anger,5,4,1,2,1,4,6,3,"I'm not worried about the effects of Corona on my personal well-being, but I'm concerned about the long-term economic consequences of mass quarantine. I find it frustrating how scared and anxious most people seem to be because of Corona, even though it poses little to no threat to the majority of them. I think the current measures meant to stop the spread of the virus will do more harm than good in the long run, because life can't just stop for several months. I do, however, appreciate the new opportunities to spend more time by myself at home, including working from home (which I've never done before).",4,Anger,9,8,2,3,3,1,2,5,"I am frustrated and angry about the fact that my life has been put on hold for almost a year due to the lockdown, but a little hopeful that with the vaccine the situation will finally go back to normal. I'm also worried about the long-term financial impact of the government support measures taken in the last few months. I feel annoyed by the people who supported and still support the lockdown, especially those that refuse to consider its social and economic damage, and closer to the people who did not. I generally feel less connected to the people around me than I used to before the lockdown. I miss seeing, visiting and interacting in person with my colleagues, friends and family."
348,6,Sadness,7,3,5,8,8,2,4,2,"At the moment I feel very sad about the experiences I am missing out on because of the coronavirus situation – I have had to leave University early and am now unable to spend time with my partner. I am also angry at the unfairness of the situation and at how the government has chosen to handle the issue. I do feel anxious about the threat of coronavirus against my personal heath and that of my family and friends, and it is also worrying to think about the effects this situation will have more widely, economically and socially. It feels frustrating that there is no clear end in sight. ",9,Anger,9,8,7,7,6,1,1,1,"I feel that the UK government have been completely ineffectual at tackling the COVID-19 situation. I feel that Tory ministers and officials have acted in their own economic interests rather than in the interests of public health, and I feel that science has been supressed in this process. I feel that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing social inequalities in the UK, and that the wilful spread of the disease through the population from early 2020 to now is nothing less than social murder. I feel that moving into autumn 2021, the country will find itself back in a similar COVID-19 situation as in the previous year because of government corruption and incompetence. "
349,8,Fear,5,2,8,8,8,3,1,2,"I feel scared and anxious about the situation, and generally not knowing when this is all going to end. I hate that we can't do our usual daily tasks, or see friends and family, and I am also quite worried about my job - as for now my workplace is closed (temporarily) but who knows what will happen if this continues. It's obviously the best thing but it worries me that over time, it will be less and less likely that we will be able to get back to normal. I don't know what else to really say that I haven't already said",7,Sadness,2,1,5,5,5,3,3,1,"I feel like nobody is taking it seriously anymore, nobody keeps their distance, some people still don't wear masks, everyone goes out everywhere yet we're only meant to be out for essential stuff. It makes me so anxious and doesn't help when I have to work throughout it too, at a place which isn't essential in the slightest and where people come in JUST for a scratchcard. It's a joke to be honest. I've had enough of it and now a date has been given for when all restrictions can be lifted, people are acting like coronavirus will have evaporated by then. It's wrong."
350,5,Relaxation,3,2,6,7,6,4,7,2,After weeks of anxiety and stress concerning the coronavirus I have started to feel more at peace. I have settled into a new routine and have kind of got used to the new normal. I have stopped worrying about what I cant control and focused on what I can eg. staying at home. I am looking forward to the day when life can become normal again and taking time to reassess life and my goals for the future when the pandemic is over. I am doing what I can to help myself and others to make it out of this situation healthy and well.,3,Relaxation,2,2,4,6,5,5,7,3,"I feel optimistic about the Coronavirus situation at the moment. It feels like progress is being made each day and the end is getting closer. I feel like I have got used to the current situation and it has become my new normal. Compared to the start of the pandemic, I feel less worry about myself and the people I care about. I feel less anxious than I did before. I am excited for the future and how it will be different when the world opens up again. Now that the vaccine is being given out, I feel like the most vulnerable people in society are going to have some protection and hopefully this will see the pandemic slow down and the virus become less dangerous and less of a threat to people."
351,5,Anxiety,2,3,3,7,1,5,2,3,My feelings at the moment are that this country is ill prepared to face this pandemic.  I think there are a lot more cases than is being reported in the news.  I'm also wondering who is leading us with the prime minister being admitted to intensive care and when are we going to turn the tide in our favour.  I am restless from being cooped up indoors and have recently been furloughed which brings money worries into the equation also.  I have written this as a string of conscious thoughts which are looping over and over in my head and kick back in with every coronavirus headline notification I get on my phone.,2,Relaxation,2,1,2,3,1,5,6,3,I feel a lot more relaxed about the corona virus situation now.  This is because it has become normal to me and also I have recently had the vaccine.  It rarely crosses my mind nowadays and the only thing that worries me is lockdowns and not being able to meet people.  I have concerns about family members who have not received the vaccine yet but I know in due course they too will be vaccinated.  I would like to see the world go back to normal and crows be in football grounds and to be able to go to the pub and things like that.
352,8,Anxiety,6,3,7,9,7,6,6,5,"I miss my friends and my life as normal. Being in the house 23/7 is getting grating. 
The news is mixed and varies every day. 

We don’t know what the future holds. Checking in on everyone I know is getting exhausted. 

Fear what will happen as this progresses. So many people have already died. The economy has crashed. What will happen to us? We can’t hide inside for ever can we?

Working from home has certainly taken some getting used and I fear my job will suffer because of it.  I miss the variety and freedom my life had just a few weeks ago. ",7,Anxiety,6,3,7,8,6,5,4,6,"I feel hope that the vaccines are here but I still fear going outside. I miss my friends a lot and it’s starting to grate. I’m irrational and irritable and I lash out at people. I want to be out and I want this stupid virus to be gone. I want to be able to travel. Or move where I want. I fear what we’ve lost thus year. Will we ever get it back. Working from home has been okay, the technology has always been there. I hope it can carry on being used. If we are out of this in 3 months, I hope we can still have a year to remember"
353,5,Sadness,2,1,4,4,6,2,2,1,I am concerned about the risk of the disease to my family and my parents and inlaws.  It feels quite away from us and that we are safe but I worry we won't be.  I am enjoying running most days. I am concerned for businesses as some most be going bust.  I am worried about my holidays in the summer and if I can't go what will happen to our money.  I am also worried about going back to work and my kids going back to school and how we will manage to get back into a rountine.  However I am enjoying being with my family and a slower pace of life. I am catching up on myself and things I wanted to do.,4,Sadness,4,2,4,5,7,5,4,3,"It feels never ending.  I am concerned about relaxing rules too early and we end back in lockdown again which would be awful. I want to be able to go out and meet friends and get food.  I want the schools back to normal and my daughters can see their friends.  It feels like we are moving at a political spped, rules are being changed because of our upcoming elections.  previously I haven't felt that, it has always felt like a clear strategy but now we are out for an election and school changes which alter depending on press reports "
354,7,Anxiety,2,3,7,8,5,2,4,1,"Currently I feel on edge as everything is very much unknown. I wish that there was a date where we know that this will all definitely be over by to give us something to hold on to, but I know that this is not possible. I fear for the children that I work with and I hope that both themselves and their families are safe. I am concerned of the impact on children's education where they are likely to be out of school for a prolonged period of time. I am worried that my father will catch the virus and as he has underlying health conditions, I pray that this would not be fatal. I am concerned for my own mental health as I am living on my own and am already finding this difficult - I wonder what my mental health will be like weeks down the line. I am thankful for everything that each and every key worker is doing and I am grateful that communities are pulling together to help one another in times of need.",4,Sadness,1,2,4,4,7,5,6,6,"I feel as though I have missed many opportunities in life and crave new experiences. I am hopeful that in the future, I’ll be able to make the most of life post-lockdown and fill it with so many new and exciting experiences. I am appreciative that I have been able to save a lot more in the past year than I normally would and I have slight apprehension about the cost of the life I want to lead post-lockdown. I miss spending time with my loved ones and can feel lonely because I live alone. I think a lot about what the future holds and it’s definitely made me more reflective. I have found that I quite like the distance people stay from each other in public but I miss the opportunity to meet new people. "
355,6,Anxiety,3,3,5,6,6,2,3,2,"I'm sure my anxiety levels are significantly higher that usual. I know someone who is being treated at the moment and it could go either way so this is upsetting me and my sleep has been interrupted, When I watch the news or speak to a friend or family member it is the main or often the only subject of the conversation so the focus is on Coronavirus pretty much all the time. I find the best time of the day currently is when I go for a walk as my daily exercise opportunity. Although the social distancing measures make that seem a little strange as well when you have keep at two metres away from people you actually know, should you see them.",5,Anxiety,2,2,3,4,2,6,6,2,I still feel anxiety at the current time. I will be happier once I have had my second vaccine shot. My anxiety is lower than it was a few months back and I see light at the end of the tunnel now. I worry about my friends and family both in terms of their physical and mental health. I am looking forward to seeing my friends again in the not too distant future and being able to attend sporting events once again. I worry still when I have to take public transport or visit the supermarket but have been washing my hands in the correct manner and taking the appropriate precautions to try and reduce my chances of infection even further and will continue to do so until advised otherwise.

It's a feeling I dont think i've felt before, I feel like I can get my life back to normal and back on track, the same feeling I'm sure is with others too.

I am also worried about the number of deaths in my city as the number is slowly rising and the number of infected is getting quite high too.

I am a bit anxious about the new strains showing up though so I'm keeping an eye on that. I am way less anxious than this time last year.

I am also looking forward to traveling again after the restrictions are lifted in other countries because I haven't been on holiday for a while because I was scared of catching coronavirus"

The anxiety comes as if i lose my job I'm wont be able to provide for my family and if there is a recession also then it will be difficult to get a new job.

I'm glad that at least I can see my parents as we are in a childcare bubble and that they have had the vaccine. I think there has been quite a bit of stress caused not just by the pandemic but the Government handling of it through each stage we seem to have been behind the curve."

I am sad for all the suffering that is happening and the injustice of the nhs workers and the carers dying for lack of safety equipment. I am sad for those experiencing grief in the worse way possible as they can't be with their loved ones or have funerals attended in the normal ways. I am curious about what life will be like for us all when all this is over. I tend to think of it as this year is a right off and I hope next year the coronavirus will have passed as I can't cope with the uncertainity of not knowing how long this is for.

My friend has been seriously ill with covid so for a while it was all very close to home but it feels like the threat has retreated a bit and I am quietly hopefully that the scientists can solve the problem but I don't trust our government so things feel like they are rather out of my control. To be honest I have bigger immediate worries in my personal life and so I am less focused on the corona situation than I would be and I am not particularly enthusiastic about getting life back to normal. It doesn't feel relevant to me currently and I am more interested in getting the infection rate as low as possible rather than  opening things up
360,5,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,1,4,5,5,I feel that the situation is so big it’s unclear where this will end. I’m still getting my head around how much this has affected my family’s lives and routine. We’ve reviewed everything from our jobs to childcare. But we’re looking at the positives and doing our best to stay safe. Communication with family is important and making sure we use common sense with keeping ourselves as safe as possible is a top priority. That’s the main thing- I think our priorities have totally changed! What matters now is our safety- not so much anything else. Who wants to be the richest person in the graveyard? I also feel guilty that our Carers and NHS staff and countless other Key Workers are out there taking risks for the sake of the rest of us. They’re pretty stuck and I’m sure don’t want to be in this situation.,6,Anger,6,5,5,5,4,4,5,3,I feel pissed off that the Government has shown such poor leadership throughout this pandemic. I feel pissed off that they’ve wasted billions of pounds on ineffective PPE but then can only manage to give the NHS a measly 1% pay rise after everything they have so selflessly done. I feel pissed off that I’m a Teacher and now have to go into school without being vaccinated when other countries are putting their Teachers first. I don’t understand why they couldn’t have gradually brought the children back to school in stages rather than all at once. I don’t understand why the test and trace system was so badly managed and  executed. I really think this government need to go.

Some anger and despair at how badly the government are handling this and communicating about it - such garbled and badly phrased messaging which doesn't resonate with people. Furious that the government continually lie, about the number of ventilators, tests, availability of PPE kit.  I despise Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson for decimating the NHS of funds and setting the route for privatisation of medicine in the UK, and now they expect the NHS to save their political careers.",4,Sadness,3,2,2,2,6,3,1,1,"I've not been too worried recently.

I am, however, extremely agnry about the Government's colossal mishandling of ths situation and their quite frankly carpet bagiing attitude to use the pandemic to give money and contracts to their pals.

I also feel that as an introvert the lockdown has made me feel safer anyway although I wish the reasons for needing it were not so harmful with loss of life. I think it has made everyone slow down and think. I think that a lot about the way we lived before will not easily or ever go back to how it was.

I am pleased with the speed of vaccine development and rollout and see that as the only way out. Too many people think it is over or cannot be bothered to work to stay safe, which upsets me. I am frustrated that governments are reopening society too quickly which will lead to increasing death rates again, and have not been impressed with how Britain has handled this. "

Currently instructions are not exactly followed by everyone, perhaps orders and rules might work.  Problems arising in that case would be to Police the orders.  I really feel there should be stricter rules imposed, perhaps a sort of curfew might help.  We need to get this thing done.  The sooner the better.  I am co corned about the impact on the economy.  I feel that the frontline staff especially nurses should have been priority in tests for Covid-19.  Sadly it appears that they have not been priority.  Grave error.",3,Sadness,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,5,"Grateful for my first dose of the vaccine.  I feel the lockdown is long.  I hope the collective efforts will end lockdown.

I have been able to take a walk everyday, read most days and take a yoga exercise once a week.  Keeping myself occupied learning new skills. I feel I am getting impatient and with limited allowed activities, I am getting tired of the same routine and in need of more diverse activity.

If the economic situation is sufficiently bad over time,  it could lead to more deaths than the coronavirus. Professor Philip Thomas' modelling from Bristol University says a 6.4% drop in GDP will lead to more deaths than beating the virus. I feel hopeful less deaths will result, if the correct balance is taken. But I also feel a bit worried the government will extend the lockdown. I feel optimistic that most people will recover and the number of deaths will fall. ",1,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,7,8,7,"I feel regretful regarding the impact this had on the the UK and other countries. However, just like we came through other pandemics in history, I feel optimistic and hopeful we will come through this, especially with the vaccine which I feel is safe and effective.

I go through phases of feeling quite relaxed and enjoying the peace, to feeling very anxious and on edge about the situation, as more news comes through every day of the reality, it keeps jolting us back to being terrified. Any normal day activity outside the house like getting medicine from the pharmacy leaves you incredibly paranoid. People are being very kind though and it seems to have united the nation. I worry more about my family members than i do myself. I think a lot of the anxiety is about not knowing when the situation is going to end, rather than the isolation itself.

Now i am concerned for myself keeping safe. I have M.E , exactly what long covid people are suffering and life is very difficult. I want the vaccine but i'm also scared of triggering relapse. Also scared of catching covid. Life feels in the balance right now."

As a teacher, it is likely that I will be needed in school again soon and that makes me feel very anxious.

I am angry at how the goalposts for exiting lockdown are being moved - our tier levels in scotland are being altered so that to move down a tier the infection rate per 100,000 has to be much lower than last years tiers. My LA was sitting at an IR last week that under last years tiers would have us in tier 1 but under her revised tiers keeps us in tier 3 which is almost still lockdown.

I also feel that the lockdown has put a huge strain upon peoples mental health. It has cost peoples lives as well as put the national health service under great pressure because of the strict rules that have been put in place. I feel that it has also contributed towards the destruction of peoples businesses and the downfall of many companies as it has put loads of people out of work. Despite Boris Johnson putting in place a roadmap to freedom, I feel that a harsher lockdown should of been implemented as I feel that we would’ve been out of this mess way earlier then we are now as we are doing incredibly bad in terms of having higher death rates then our European counterparts.

In situation like this i will be more than happy penalties for going out to become serious and everyone going out to feel them. Otherwise some people can go out other not.

It also annoys that parents either have no control/or interest in their children and are allowing them to go out and meet in gangs

I don't see why certain business are getting priority over others, the media is not essential, but rich tv and movie stars seem to be able to travel and do what they want whilst we are locked down. Other countries that don't have a lock down like us are doing ok. A lot of the people getting sick are fat and unhealthy so why should everyone else suffer for self inflicted illnesses.

People's enthusiasm for Zoom has faded and I am scraping the barrel with what boxsets I have left to watch.  Although having said that the time to step away from the rushing around, has been positive too.

I believe the NHS are doing all they can and we, as a nation should do everything we can to support them, which includes staying indoors unless completely necessary but people can't even manage this.

I really hope that people can pull together and don't drag this out longer than it needs to, although the pessimist in me isn't expecting that much.

I worry that she will get sick, not from the corona virus but from something else, and I will not be able to get treatment for her. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying that things will never get back to normal for any of us. I don't miss work because I hate my job but the lack of normal routine is having an effect on my mental health. I am trying to keep healthy by exercising each day but it is a real struggle. I can't believe I am living this. The terrible news each day and the losses people have to endure is unreal. How can someone survive having a child one day and knowing that they are being buried alone the next?",7,Anxiety,6,3,7,8,7,1,2,1,"I feel anxiety for myself and my family. I am a front line worker and next week will be mixing with 900 plus people per day again. I am not vaccinated so I can't see my family safely even if I was allowed to, but I'm told it's 'safe' to deal with other people's. It's not safe - how can it be?I don't trust the government at all because there have been so many 'u' turns. I am now taking medication for anxiety and depression which all stems from the risk I associate with my job. Maybe I will feel differently as more people are vaccinated but what a sad, sad death toll this country has. Covid was not controlled or handled properly in the UK, from the start up until now."

It is particularly worrying for older members of he family who are self isolating but there is also significant impact on their mental health. We are attempting to maintain social distancing but this can be difficult, particularly in shops. It is also incredibly boring and restricting on how we normally lead our lives that leads to further anxiety. I am worried for everyone and also the ability of our country to continue effectively economically",7,Fear,2,2,4,4,3,4,4,5,I feel hope for the future and getting back to normal but have anxiety that new strains of the virus will delay things and poor uptake of the vaccine will also affect our progress. I also have concerns about the economy and worry for my son who is shortly to join the job market. I would dearly love to get back to doing some of the things I used to enjoy such as holidays and even just going for a coffee in a café. I think the pandemic has polarised people and driven us apart rather than us having a shared fighting spirit.

I feel slightly relieved as the death figures have reduced for the UK as a whole but in particular they have plummeted in Scotland for 2 days in a row to 2 deaths per day.  However, I'm a little anxious as to whether this will continue and hoping that people don't relax the advice of self isolating or social distancing because of this as this would undo the good that has been done.  I still feel a little ponderous as to how this virus has started and the cause.  I also get very annoyed about people not being respectful of the 2 metre distance.  I feel pretty anxious about the economy also as I'm wondering about the long term effects this lock down will have on the country and the world.  There is so much hardship and poverty already in this country.",6,Happiness,1,1,1,2,1,4,2,1,"I feel quite relieved that the R number has decreased and that people are becoming more hopeful about the future.  That being said, I still feel a bit cautious regarding the future with the new variants and how the vaccines will deal with these.  We know how much effort and time it takes to produce a vaccine and vaccinate most of the population, therefore, if these vaccines have to be tweaked this takes time and then the population would most likely have to have a booster which takes a lot of time and effort.  My worry is that we could be in and out of lockdown for quite a long time if this was the case."

398,6,Anxiety,4,4,6,7,6,6,5,6,"I feel worried and anxious about how this virus is going to come to an end. I am also thinking and worrying about my elderly in laws and parents and the fact that my husband and I can’t be with them not helping them at the moment. 
In other hand, I feel more and more the weight of privilege, right now, I’m not working but being paid my employer, I have a safe and nice house to be, with a bit of a garden when there are sunny days. I’m in a loving relationship so don’t have the worry of being abuse in my own home, I don’t have children to worry about nor to think about homeschooling, I have time to cook a healthy meal, I have money to do so, I have times and wifi for exercise, getting in touch with family and friends online. So I’m really grateful and privileged, how about poorer parts of the country and the world where there’s no space like shanty towns and favelas? This worries me a lot. 

But also hopeful and happy that perhaps this will bring about a new normal - where the rat race isn’t going to be so overrated as it was. So I’m always thinking about the both sides of the coin which makes me anxious and helpless. My main question is - how to help others in this situation?

The kids are about to come back to school and I get worried about my husband - who was declared ‘key worker’ since he works for the government at the begin of the pandemic. He’s been going to the office all this time and kept safe especially on public transport. Is that social distancing will be kept? I’m not sure -  people are being shortsighted, they think that cause they took the vaccine is back to normal life in a flick of a switch and they are not respecting social distancing or even wearing masks anymore. People are already breaking rules after rules, and that makes life harder on people that can’t work from home and needs to use public transport.  
At the end of the day,  I just want myself and my family and friends to be kept safe, as selfish as that statement might be. "

Perhaps we need a bit of cleansing. I almost feel a bit disappointed how with this virus, since it's not really that deadly (not with the current strain anyway) we won't nearly end up as many deaths as would be considered as a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cleansing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

I feel a bit frustrated how it will probably be us who has to clean up all the mess now even though statistically we should be the least at risk group. My partner is on furlough at the moment and has been forced to seek new employment and I'm just worried about the uncertainty of the future. I guess I'm a bit angry as well at the absolute lack of leadership that the government has demonstrated throughout. I find it disgusting how some people would take this opportunity to further their own political agendas without real or apparent regard for what's right for the general public. Particularly the PM's conduct and attitude towards the entire thing has just been plain embarrassing. I guess I'm a bit sad as well because I'm pessimistic about the future of UK, with Brexit going on as well and whatnot. "

I have messaged my friends and they all seem okay but it’s not the same. Tv is boring after a while and I feel like I will soon be crawling up the walls. 
I feel like the government is doing a good job, they have channelled the NHS. An institution that is properly the only thing all Brits agree on. We police by consent.

I am also employed as a front line health professional, work is just so draining, there are demands from the public, there are extra demands from my employers, there are also additional challenging demands put on us centrally from the NHS, yet there is not enough support, and this is really draining. ",7,Fear,3,3,7,6,4,2,2,2,"Even though the number of cases and deaths are reducing I am still very concerned, as opening the economy will lead to an increase in cases. Plus in time we will have a situation where the virus will have mutated and current vaccines will be ineffective. The politics are only bothered about the economy, and wish to open it as fast as possible without considering the impact on people's health. I think that in hindsight we should have vaccinated the workers first and told the elderly too stay at home and keep shielding. Then the economy could have been opened up, without an increase in infection rates, then the elderly should have been vaccinated."

However, I'm relieved that my job is (for the time being) safe, and that no-one I know has suffered any major effects.

It seems that no country in the world was really ready for this, nor did they have any plans. It is as though it was never expected to happen. The testing in the UK for antigens is not working and a lot of taxpayers money has been spent on this. Emergency services are grossly overstretched and people are being badly informed. The only useful strategies have been hand washing, distancing from others and not going out unless necessary. Masks and gloves being worn day after day by the public may even accumulate the pathogen but no advice on this has been given.",7,Disgust,2,8,6,3,8,1,6,5,"I am sad that Covid-19 is so relentless.

I am surprised that this was allowed to happen despite the warnings of the Bill Gates TED talk of 2015 and Event 21 of 2019. I was also very surprised at the transmission rate.
It seems that economic constraints have now been placed on the UK for many years to come and there is still uncertainty as to the efficacy of vaccination. I am also concerned that masks and social distancing will weaken the population's immunity to other illnesses."

I feel that if the government had introduced the lockdown two weeks before they did, as France and Spain did, our situation would not be what it is now and we would have less deaths from the covid 19 outbreak.",6,Sadness,6,3,4,5,7,2,7,1,"I feel that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel.

Me and my family adhered to all regulations and I am furious how much sacrifice we made compared to those who were flouting the rules, having parties and enjoying themselves. I just want this whole thing to stop.

I am very tired and stressed and in need of a break - my situation is that I am a single parent of a teenager and also care for my elderly father (who has dementia) at home. Usually I have respite breaks where my dad goes into a care home for a week or so and I and my son can have a break from the situation. This has obviously not been possible due to the virus being so prevalent in care homes (my elderly cousin died of Covid in one in January) - it has been too risky to take the chance Also, if there was an outbreak while dad was in one, we would not be allowed to get him back out. So we have just had to cope. I'm so relieved, however, that we seem to be coming towards the end of this - dad has had his vaccine, and I have just been offered it.

There are no flu figures anymore (50,000 deaths in UK a few years ago) and we have a test that even the creator of said it should not be used for viruses. Go figure!

Large corporations (especially banks) need to be sympathetic rather than looking at opportunities to boost their public relations and marketing,
Most people I am aware of are keeping to the rules laid out by the government. i.e. keeping 2 metres apart, staying in the house, etc. But exercise is important, especially for those people in small houses with no garden, and I do not believe in demonising people who go to parks to get fresh air.

The huge death toll saddens and angers me. The 1% pay rise for nurses infuriates me and is truly representative of the lack of any kind of understanding of the mood of the people. "
443,7,Anxiety,4,3,6,7,6,1,1,2,"It has caused me anxiety and sadness, as I'm unable to see my partner, family and friends being that we are on lockdown. I'm also worried about my dad catching it, as he is high risk with having lung problems and poor health anyway. I worry too about the effect on our mental health and economy, many people are losing their jobs and small businesses will be affected too. Thankfully my job isn't affected as I am a key worker but my friends work in retail and hospitality and they have been unable to work because of it. It is also a strain on our NHS, which has not been funded properly for years ",9,Anger,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,"My dad passed away from covid the other day and I currently have covid too. I feel anger, upset, frustration and anxiety. Covid has robbed me of a father, my mother of a husband, my partner from a future father in law and my family of a brother, uncle and brother in law. I feel anger that people are not taking it seriously and that some people feel that it does not exist. They should feel thankful that they have not been affected by this pandemic. I'm glad that there is now a vaccine. I have been able to have this due to work, therefore my symptoms are currently not too bad. "
444,7,Sadness,3,3,7,7,8,3,2,2,Some people are still very ignorant about what this virus is.  They just don't understand how important it is to isolate. The government has to impose a complete lock down immediately to protect everyone. I'm scared for my family at this time. I miss them and am afraid that I won't be able to go to my brother's wedding in August if the quarantine is extended because of stupid people ignoring basic guidance. It makes me so angry and frustrated that some people think they're exempt from the rules.,6,Sadness,5,5,5,7,8,1,2,1,"It's still a very uncertain time. No work and looks like I'll have to start my business from scratch again in April. This time with no money, big over draft at the moment. Scared for the future, near AND far. Worried about finances but also about relaxing the covid lockdown rules. The vaccine scares me too - the side affects and long term issues, discrimination if you don't have it. Life will never be the same as pre-covid. I feel sorry for the younger people and next few generations. It is going to take a hundred years to pay for 2020. "
445,9,Fear,8,7,9,7,6,4,4,5,The situation with Coronavirus is one that is very scary for everyone. Our way of life has been completely changed and it's had a significant impact on me and I'm sure others. The overriding feeling that I have is fear.  I fear mostly of getting it and giving to the people I love. I also have anger at the government for allowing it to get to this stage and for being ill-prepared.  Anxiety is also an issue as I have to look after getting supplies in for people and not knowing when this will all be over.,9,Anger,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,"I feel the same as I have done throughout the pandemic. I am scared, anxious and angry mostly. Seeing so many mistakes by the governments and so many people ignoring advice is extremely frustrating. The fact so many people have died and so many families have suffered avoidable tragedies is a black mark on the human race. I am not hopeful for the future as there are a lot of people who still don't get it, or who are far too eager to return to old ways when we are not ready to do so. I would be in favour of going slow and taking time to ensure people are safe and fully vaccinated. "
446,8,Anxiety,2,1,7,9,7,2,1,1,"I’m not worried for me, as I’m a 32 year old “healthy” male. I worry about my wife who has asthma and my elderly mother who has underlying health problems. I don’t worry for myself I worry for others if they were to get it would have complications. That is my only concern. I know others are worried about their financial situation but fortunately mine isn’t going to suffer due to the virus. Hearing the death toll everyday makes you anxious and hearing the news around the world. I try to look at the news once a day just so I know the essential and then tune it out so it’s not overwhelming. ",6,Anxiety,4,7,7,8,7,2,1,1,Still very anxious and apprehensive as I’ve worked all the way throughout with the public. There is hope with the vaccines and cases and deaths coming down so that’s something to be encouraged about. But slightly worried to hear about different variants. So cautious but optimistic about everything. I know I’m a way off getting my vaccine but hopeful to get it and will the second I receive my invite. Vaccines are the only way out of this mess and the fact we’re doing well in this country gives everyone reason to be hopeful.
447,8,Anxiety,2,1,6,8,4,1,1,1,"I have just heard that the UK Prime Minister has been taken into the  Intensive Care Unit, this is absolutely shocking and I feel very anxious and a bit frightened. I was already feeling pretty anxious and slightly fearful but hearing this news has totally shocked and appalled me. I have felt a lot more anxious since the virus has become more and more widespread, this anxiety partly comes from being a key worker and partly due to having a child with asthma. I fear that if I catch the virus I could pass it to my husband or my son.",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,5,7,1,"I feel pretty optimistic about the current situation in the uk regarding corona virus. With easing of restrictions on the horizon and a decline in cases and hospitalisations I feel happier now than I have for the past few months. I have had my vaccine and my husband should have his in the next few months we can look forward to the future. I’m looking forward to booking a holiday abroad and also to seeing my family and being able to go to a restaurant for a nice meal with my family. It will be good for my son to get back to college, he has ASD and the lockdowns have had a negative effect on him and his mental health, he will be glad to get back to a routine that he enjoys."
448,8,Anxiety,4,4,8,9,5,4,3,3,"very scared that I'll get it, I am already in an at risk group. The likelyhood of serious harm to myself is high with my pre-existing conditions. My social situation is like everybody else's deteriorating and will take many months to improve judging by the progression of the virus and the impact on the social and economic life in this country. all activities that i used to participate in have been closed off to me I do not work so do not get much (any) social contact. The activities I would like to be able to do are not likely to resume in any particular hurry either.",7,Sadness,3,1,4,4,6,2,4,3,"Less sanguine than I was, feel a little relieved that have had first vaccine, although personally I feel a little depressed generally.
I do not feel this is only due to pandemic situation but also other personal factors.
Life is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""grey"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" at the moment with little relief, I do not believe that th lockdown will properly end for a good few months yet and that activities will continue to be constrained by covid rules such as social distancing, hand washing maybe mask wearing, society will not return to pre pandemic state for most people."
449,8,Anxiety,6,3,8,8,8,1,1,1,"This is such a difficult position to be in. It is definitely the uncertainty of not knowing when this situation will improve that I find most difficult to handle. I am scared that my family, my loved ones or myself could catch the virus. Reading the daily gloomy news from across the globe is so sad and makes me feel incredibly helpless. Knowing that I will have to do the weekly grocery shop soon feels me with dread. I also find it hard to explain to our children what is going on. They are way too young to fully understand, but they know that life looks a little different right now. ",7,Anxiety,2,2,8,8,2,4,4,3,"Until I am vaccinated, I will still feel very worried about the current situation. I have a constant fear of catching the virus, especially now that schools are back open and we have no control over the fact that our children might bring the virus home from school, We do everything we can to protect ourselves, but I still feel helpless in this situation. I know that even if we catch the virus, our chances are good of not becoming too ill with it, but if we can avoid getting it, than this is what we will most certainly do. "
450,5,Relaxation,2,1,3,5,4,6,7,3,At this moment my main anxiety or worry over the coronavirus is about the economy.  I am concerned whether the country can return to a `normal' state and how long this will take.  I am concerned about my own income in the longer term as I work in the social care sector which is very stretched financially having to find extra resources to cover the staff sickness.  I am also concerned about the health of my loved ones though several of my older more vulnerable relatives including my father passed away last year.,3,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,2,6,6,3,I feel quite relaxed about the situation.  I tested positive for covid in January when there was an outbreak where I work.  I work in a social care setting and the outbreak spread very quickly. Luckily I work with children and not the elderly so none of the residents were seriously unwell.  I was quite unwell and had to take nearly a month off work.  The number of infections nationally is now dropping considerably and i'm feeling optimistic about everything returning to near normal in the future.
451,8,Fear,6,6,8,8,7,3,5,3,"I feel afraid of how the U.K. will cope over the next few weeks and I how it will ever recover. How will the children cope going back to school, how will the country cope financially? How and when will people mourn the loss of loved ones? I am also afraid that there will be so many investigations, looking for blame and how we could’ve dealt with this pandemic better when more time and focus needs to be on recovering as a nation and as smaller communities. Many people are not adhering to guidelines and although this has been a dreadful start to 2020, storms and now there is sunshine people want to go outside and they can’t. I worry about how police service will cope and NHS staff and the other key workers. ",7,Anxiety,7,7,7,7,8,5,4,3,"I am very worried about the current situation and the long term impact the pandemic has had on everyone.  We all crave some sort of normality but I fear people are becoming impatient and angry.  I am sad and worried about the future.  I am also is complete admiration for the scientists and the research to develop a vaccine so quickly!
I am disgusted with the devolved governments and their handling of the pandemic.  And over the last few days a 1% pay rise for NHS staff is appalling...clapping for them was a romantic notion to say thank you and now this 1% pay rise is shocking...they deserve more than that!"
452,7,Sadness,3,5,6,5,8,6,5,4,Worried because I have to work tomorrow looking after the children of key workers. Angry because some of the children don’t Really need to be there and yet their difficult parents are putting them at risk and lying to us about why they should be classes as key workers. Angry because those children are the worst behaved. Sad because I could catch it and give it to my children. Scared of the future for my children if anything happens to me. Happy because the family time together at home has been nice. I like the improved sense of community that people seem to have but also disappointed that some people are ignoring social distancing rules.,6,Fear,1,1,5,4,6,6,6,6,Nervous about schools opening up next week as there is no social distancing or protection. Nervous in case either I or my children have to isolate because of close cases in schools. Worried about my husband working on Covid wards. Fearful that numbers will rise and pause the reopening of society and push back the planned openings. Frustrated that I can’t do the things I want to or go to the places I would like to go. Shopping online for everything is difficult and not always practical. It also impacts finances while waiting for refunds.
453,7,Anxiety,2,1,6,8,1,3,3,1,"About 15 minutes ago, the news broke about the prime minister being admitted to the ICU, so that was a shock and made it even more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""real"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to me than it already was. My anxiety has definitely increased, especially as I am high risk, but there isnt much I can do about it other than social distancing, intensive handwashing and trying not to touch my face. There have been reports of people ignoring the lockdown too, so that is adding to the stress of it. The increase of sinophobia I've been seeing on the internet, blaming Chinese people for the virus (mostly from Americans) is making me worry that there might be another pointless, stupid war that will kill millions.",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,2,1,7,3,"The vaccine rollout going well (20 million people have got the first dose) is making me hopeful, however the sheer amount of people still not wearing masks despite the virus still being around is making me a little anxious. 
Hopefully it gets stamped out for good, but i am slightly worried it's just going to stick around forever, what with the new mutations springing up regularly all around the globe.
i am also worried about the relief packages being stopped far too soon, to the detriment of the working class."
454,3,Anxiety,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,2,"Personally, I am fine, I am healthy with no underlying conditions and am working from home. The personal impact on me is that I've had to cancel several holidays and social activities I had planned. My day to day life hasn't been really affected. The only people I am concerned about is my elderly father but I spoke to him yesterday and he is currently fine.

I've been affected by having to go food shopping less often and it taking longer because I have to queue and go to several shops.

I'm anxious about how long this lockdown is going to be, I know we need to do it but I am not particularly enjoying not being able to go out. I feel the government aren't doing very well at managing this given many nurses have said they have no PPE and the govt initially ignored offers for help from some companies",6,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,1,7,6,6,"ready for lockdown to be over, but ok with the timeline set out.  vaccine rollout going well. very angry at government for their mishandling of this pandemic beforehand though. happy to work from home forever really, i enjoy having no commute and a better work life balance. nhs pay rise is easily do-able, decrease the mp salary. most people not really following lockdown properly to be honest, lots of non mask wearers, people shopping not alone. this pandemic has lasted a lot longer than necessary because people didn't follow the rules"
455,7,Anxiety,3,5,6,7,8,4,4,2,"At the moment I would say i have a level of anxiety and fear as I am a key worker. Anxious about going to work and possibly catching the virus and fearful i may pass it on if caught to family members. I wish people generally would take the situaton more seriously and follow the government guidelines. On my travels to work i see numerous people out and about, far too many to make the environment safe for everybody.  The situation in supermarkets is somewhat better than in recent weeks, however deliveries are very scarce and understandably for vulnerable people only. However this means that more people who are not classed as vulnerable are descending on supermarkets which is not ideal and i have seen numerous queues to get in, where people are not practising social distancing.                                   ",5,Anxiety,1,2,2,5,3,4,4,3,"                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The rate r  will go up in the coming weeks due to the number of school children returning to educatuion all at once. This will have a significant impact on the r rate and we will see morre resrictions t in place due to this. Another wave of coronavirus is inevitable in the coming months when more of the restrictions are lifted. The current government are only concerned about money and not the effects to the health of the nation. This can be seen with the paltry 1% offer to NHS workers aa pay rise. Without hem many more woud die.

456,6,Anxiety,3,2,5,6,5,4,6,2,"I feel a bit more concerned and anxious than I did yesterday. Although the overall situation in England is following the trend I expected (or is, perhaps, better than that, as overall new cases and deaths are declining - I expected the peak to be next Tuesday), I heard today that a resident of my mother's sheltered accommodation complex had been taken to hospital last week, and has now tested positive for the virus. So I have to decide whether she should stay where she is, or move in with my wife and me. Either way has risks; but now staying put is considerably riskier than it appeared yesterday.",3,Relaxation,2,1,2,3,6,7,8,5,"I'm feeling largely relieved (but that might more reflect the end of a busy and stressful day); and I'm encouraged by the progress of the vaccination programme. However, I'm still concerned that risks persist, and that cases have risen locally during February, and my community has seen its first cases. That means that there is still legitimate cause for concern, and the need for vigilance continues. But after all the disappointments of the autumn and winter, there is at last grounds for believing that something like pre-Covid normality will be possible before the end of June. This is a reason for hope. "
457,6,Anxiety,4,6,4,7,6,3,4,1,"I feel that the institutions of government and the media have quite likely put a lot of people in danger. The government has been woefully unprepared to deal with the situation and the media, for the most part has been unwilling to ask serious questions about this and put the required pressure on them to sort it. The fact that up until two weeks ago, the strategy was to be focused on 'herd immunity' has been completely memory holed and the shortage of protective equipment for NHS workers has been obfuscated by constant repetition of the phrase 'whatever it takes' to pliant journalists. ",4,Sadness,8,6,6,6,9,3,2,2,"Mostly I feel angry at the government and the media for creating a situation where so many people have died and so many more are facing financial ruin.  I think that there have been so many opportunities over the last year to deal with the pandemic better, and we know they could have done it as they are doing a good job with the vaccine. I think that everything is a little hopeless and although there is a very good chance things will go back to normal soon, nobody will face any repercussions for the corruption and mismanagement that the pandemic exposes."
458,9,Anxiety,8,3,8,9,8,2,2,2,"i feel like nothing will ever be the same again and that humans will take a long time to get back to some form of normality.
I am fearful for my parents health and wellbeing and it is very frustrating not seeing friends.
i am hoping that humans will learn a lesson from this and fund the correct things in the future, like research, medicine, hospitals etc.
I have seen the best of and the worst of the human spirit recently with a rise in crime =s like theft from the poor but also seen some great volunteers out there helping those in need.",8,Sadness,4,4,6,6,8,2,2,2,"An overall feeling of being worn down after 1 year with restrictions. 
Totally understand why it is happening but angry with myself for not making the most of a year of working from home. 
I have become unfit and put weight on where you would think the opposite would be true with more time on your hands.
Before the pandemic if someone would have said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""you have a year of no travelling to work"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I would have thought """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""great - I can concentrate on fitness and health"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but the reality is the opposite.
I do like not sitting in traffic for an hour each way but I do tend to work longer now."
459,8,Anxiety,4,4,9,9,8,2,3,1,"I feel very anxious about the current situation. I feel it's like a 'waiting game' and the uncertainty makes things very difficult to face. The fact we don't know what the outcome is is very unsettling. No one is sure when this will be over and life will return to normal. I feel scared, worried, anxious and frightened but at the same time life has slowed down and I'm becoming adjusted to the 'new normal' and my wellbeing has most certainly improved what with getting more sleep and not having to commute for 3 hours a day I am seeing at least one benefit from this awful situation.",6,Anxiety,3,3,4,8,6,5,4,4,I do feel anxious about life returning to 'normal'. It's been a year of living like this and I almost feel like this is my normal now and I'm anxious to go back into work and socialise again. I'm worried how my life might change as I've become used to this way of life. It would be lovely to see friends and family once again and hug relatives but I am anxious to go back to work as my work-life balance and mental health has improved significantly since working from home. I hope employers see this as a good opportunity to allow more remote working to better the well-being of their employees.

I am proud and happy about the sefless work that many people have put into keeping people safe. I am anxious about the affect social distancing will have on people and that isolation will cause alot of sadness, Not being able to go out is putting stress on me and my partner as we do not have a lot of space so we are getting on each others nerves more than normal. this is a few sentences I dont now what else you want?
",4,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,2,7,8,6,I am hopefull that we have got through the worst of the crisis and that we will be able to live a more normal life in the coming months. The most vulnerable in society have been or are being vaccinated. Personally whilst I don't know when I will be able to be vaccinated I am fairly comfortable continuing with social distancing until that has happened. So I guess I'm feeling hopeful and relaxed at this stage. Until it is almost completley removed as threat I am going to be slightly anxious about my own health as I know even if it doesn't kill you the health effects can be very bad.
461,6,Anxiety,6,6,7,7,7,4,4,4,"I feel afraid because it's likely that my family or friends may be affected by this. I believe the government are doing everything they can but a lot of it is so unknown that it is difficult for them to know what action to take and this worries me. I also worry about the impact on the economy and how this will affect my children as they grow up. It is the unknown element of all of these factors that makes me feel anxious about this situation. It has been nice to spend time with my family but that is overshadowed by the horrible disease and the amount of people dying from it.
",3,Happiness,3,4,3,5,2,7,6,5,"I feel optimistic now the vaccine programme has worked so well and cases are falling country wide. I am hopeful that schools going back won't start another surge in cases and even if they do, the success of the vaccination programme should mean that cases won't translate to deaths. I think the media need to be more responsible and stop trying to scaremonger with stories about new variants. The science says these variants are of low concern but the media blow it out of proportion to get clicks and sell advertising space.

I’m irritated that others are paid 80% of their wage to stay at home, whilst I am paid my normal wage to put myself at risk.
I worry that I could contract the virus at work and pass this onto my immediate family at home.
I am also concerned that Boris Johnson is in hospital and suspect his health is worse than has been disclosed ",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,1,5,8,5,"I feel optimistic that the end of the pandemic is near. Cases and death rates are falling daily and hospital admissions are reducing. The vaccination program is going very well. I’m hopeful the risk of covid is finally reducing abc becoming manageable. I expect annual vaccine boosters to control new variants of the virus.
Lockdown has been difficult and hard for everyone but the efforts and definitely paying off and I’m hopeful normality will return shortly.
The difficult part will be keeping to current restrictions and not becoming complacent and relaxing too soon."
463,7,Anxiety,4,3,6,8,8,4,3,1,I am fed up. Mainly because I'm working from home at the minute so not seeing anyone during the week. I'm also lonely as family can't visit from overseas and all my social opportunities have been cancelled. I feel isolated and like rubbish generally because my routine is gone and every day is like the last. I keep having stressful dreams so my sleep is poor and overall I just feel on edge all the time from anxiety. Everything and everyone is strained and stressed and it's horrendous. I really can'twait to this is over. The worst thing about it is that noone has any idea of when that might be.,3,Sadness,2,1,2,4,8,1,2,6,"I am absolutely fed up. I'm so utterly bored and fed up. I want to eat in a restaurant instead of doing dishes every single night after eating my bog standard crappy cooking. I want to be able to fly home to Belfast and see my loved ones as I moved right before the pandemic and now haven't seen any friends or family in 18 months. I can't make any new friends as there are no social opportunities. Book club is cancelled and you can't make friends over random Zooms. I want to go to the cinema for date night and see a new film instead of watching Netflix on the sofa again. I want to go get a coffee with a colleague during my lunch break instead of shoving a sandwich into me in my spare room because I worry that because no one can see me, work might think I'm slacking. I wish I could have normal conversations witj colleauges rather than worrying about how things come across over email or having stilted phone calls because you don't know what their take on things are. I started the job just as lockdown started and have no idea whether I do tasks the same way as everyone else or take the same length of time. I have ran out of things to talk about and spend my time off half wishing I was at work so I'd have something to do.

I'm happy about the lock down to reduce the likelihood of infection.  I don't think it is too much of a hassle if it works.  I have been a bit obsessive with the news - I've even watched the Orange Oaf's update from the USA on the BBC website when he shows what a ghastly human being he is. I do get irritated with stories of people visiting the beach, etc. on the weekends.",6,Anxiety,3,1,2,6,2,3,5,2,I feel a bit impatient about getting the vaccine and a little anxious about catching Covid before I get vaccinated.  I've taken my 90 year-old mother for both doses and the first time I was impressed by the organisation but also almost overcome with emotion thinking this could be our way out - I sincerely hope it is.  Although the end of the tunnel is in sight it looks as though the effects on the economy and non-covid health issues will last for years.  The death toll in the UK doesn't look good compared with other countries and you can't help thinking that some poor decisions have been made by the government.

Perhaps I am also uneasy about the fact that I cannot travel and might not be able to do it in the future. All in all, the situation is far from perfect but I try not to panic. I take every day as it comes and try to keep myself busy with work and exercises not to go crazy and not to waste too much time.

When you have just a few years of your life left and every minute counts, so many unticked bucket list items are still there, the last thing you want is the lockdown inertia. "

Being isolated socially is difficult at times. However, I am feeling good at the moment. I worked a lot on self-improvement today, I had time to read about interesting topics and meditate. I even managed to get out for a small walk, as I'm lucky that there is a path near my home where not a lot of people travel through.

As I said about family also, I don't live with my parents but both of them and my little brother are all classified as essential workers which means they are still going to their jobs. My partner who lives with me also works with my mum and so he is classified as an essential worker and I'm worried for their safety and health.

If everyone actually listened to the rules we had back in March 2020 instead of ignoring them and if the government acted a bit like Australia's government with the pandemic, then we wouldn't be still in this position a year on. Yes, the vaccine roll-out is working but there's still a massive cluster of people who either can't or won't get it. 

I also think this pandemic has been hard hitting on the already hard hitting mental health situation. It has made lots of people sadder especially this Winter lockdown. In the Summer lockdown, we had the sunshine and people were gardening and we had that to keep us at home along with enjoyable walks. But now, this Winter lockdown is a complete 360 as we had dark days, rainy weather and we didn't have the sunshine until 9-10pm. In my opinion, it's brought on a lot of extra un-needed depression too."

I feel across the world a lot of countries are started to turn the tide on this virus which does make me hopeful we can do the basics to get this under control.

It's also affecting home life as well due to girlfriend working from home who has mental health issues herself,so managing the two does make me frustrated and sometimes angry.

The current government are totally out of touch with people and only seem to make things worse for the average person. They are punishing the lower classes whilst making the rich richer. It's almost possible for people now to work their way up to the things we are taught we have to have like a house or having kids. Honestly this Covid thing has just highlighted how out of touch those in power are and how much things need to change. Hopefully in the next 5 years things will get better and our government will actually be there for its people instead of for their own pockets.

I will have the vaccine, although worry about it making me ill in the short term. I worry about the talk of vaccine passports, whilst I can see the benefit for protecting the vulnerable. There is enough division in the world already with apparent black vs white; men vs women; rich vs poor. It just seems to be something else that may divide the population. Which makes me sad.

I also feel lucky as I am not currently struggling financially and I know that many have little or no income.  

Anxiety is something I am keen to minimise, as a result, I have chosen not to follow developments too closely although I have made sure I am fully aware of all safety measures and our family took the decision to adopt social distancing and remain inside 10 days before the majority of people.

bizarrely, i'm in an odd situation where i still live with my ex, so despite being friends the relationship becomes more strained. i'm also involved with a married woman and it's incredibly frustrating to only have online contact with her, especially when others think it's acceptable to visit their second home against their own advice!",6,Relaxation,3,3,2,3,3,6,8,5,"I mostly feel sleepy, i've just had dinner and it's nearly bedtime. i'm pretty happy mostly, fairly settled in lockdown but looking forward to getting out again.

",4,Disgust,2,6,1,1,2,4,5,2,"I feel frustrated at the handling. I’m frustrated at the thought of vaccine certificate and not being able to enter the world post covid without one. It feels like the government are trying to force themselves into everything we deal with. I feel frustrated at how long we as a country have been in lockdown, everything seems to be dragging and on many occasions I’m not sure I believe what is going on with the give. I feel quite excited at the prospect on coming out of lockdown. I am a bit apprehensive about how busy everywhere will be straight after we come out after lockdown."
493,7,Anxiety,6,1,7,9,6,4,4,2,"I am anxious for my older relatives in case they catch the virus and fearful of their safety, especially when they have other health issues that mean they have to go to hospitals for appointments. I feel anxious when I go food shopping that everything we are doing is being watched and scrutinised for errors. I feel sad when my 3 year old is crying because she misses her friends and wants to go the park and she doesn't really understand why we can't go. I feel lucky to have a safe house and small garden to spend our lockdown in and happy to be seeing more of my husband and daughter.",5,Sadness,2,1,4,4,6,4,3,1,"Frustrated that I am going back into work in a school with no vaccine and mixing with lots of children when I can't see my parents indoors. Tired of not travelling far and seeing others break the rules. Hope that there is a route out of lockdown and that we can see our families more in the summer and enjoy a holiday as our household. Worry about the rates rising as the lockdown in eased and having to postpone events again. Worry that my daughter who is now 4 will remember this part of her life and look back feeling that she missed out on part of her childhood, not seeing family or friends at Christmas, not being able to have a birthday party. "
494,8,Sadness,2,1,6,6,6,4,5,2,"I feel quite scared at the moment because a lot of my family are key workers so I worry for their safety. I feel anxious as to when it will be over because it is just awful to see people dying. I hate the fact that underlying illnesses keep getting pointed out as if it makes it any better, everyone has their time to go and theirs was still cut short. I hate the government's response to the pandemic, it was too lax at the beginning and showed how little they cared for the UK population. I know they will continue to deny their policy of herd immunity and will probably get away with it which honestly boils my blood. However, I do feel so grateful for every key worker that are putting their lives at risk for the rest of the population and I am looking forward to getting my life back.",3,Sadness,2,3,2,4,6,3,5,3,"The vaccine rollout has gave me peace of mind about my own health as well as my families. However, as much as I am not as worried about corona affecting my well-being, I do think it has had a negative impact on my mental health. It takes a lot for me to focus doing university work and I lack the energy to get up and exercise that I used to have. I also sleep a lot less than I probably should. However, the announcement Boris Johnson made recently has definitely gave me a lot of hope and I am not feeling as negative as I have been. "
495,7,Sadness,4,2,6,6,7,4,5,3,"I worry about he state of my children’s education when they all go back to school. I am also very worried about my parents and other vunerable relatives trying to keep them safe and at home as some do not realise just how serious the situation is. I am very anxious about leaving my youngest child at school mixing with other children as I have to work, as does my husband as we are both key workers. I am trying to keep positive about everything as trying to look tern, what are the positives we can take out of the situation.",3,Relaxation,2,1,2,1,1,6,6,7,"I’m hopeful we are near the end but fearful that people will go out too much so will send us into another lockdown before it ends. I don’t think we’ll have the summer we think we’re going to have as people still don’t realise how bad a pandemic we are living in .
I’m also worried about my children’s education and how much work they have missed in the last year. The government and teachers need to work together and very hard, to help our children be where they need to be with their education. I hope that by the end of this year , life will be relatively back to as normal as we will get. "
496,7,Sadness,2,1,7,7,9,3,4,3,"I am not worried about myself but I am worried about many others and the fact that people my age (21) are dying worries me a bit. It also makes me think about death a lot and how fragile humans actually are. I am extremely worried now that the prime minister is in intensive care as this shows that the virus is not discriminatory when attacking. I try not to read the news too often as it can make me more anxious about the situation but I feel like I need to stay informed about what is going on. I feel quite fortunate in that because I am introverted I am not really affected by lockdown, but I am worrying about how other people are coping.

I myself am frustrated with lockdown and how my life is on hold but feel guilty for thinking like this as other people have suffered much more. It makes me feel selfish but I am angry that as a healthy individual I am effectively a prisoner in my own home.
I have had my first vaccine but had bad side effects from it and was bed bound for  3 days. I am not looking forward to the second dose and have thought about taking time off work in case I'm ill again."
497,7,Anxiety,6,4,7,7,6,4,2,3,I am very anxious about Coronavirus. I am scared and anxious that I will get it and die because the news keeps talking about young people dying. Every time I have a slight tickle in my throat or cough I think I have got it. I am worried about my financial situation as my partner cannot longer work and we also have a young daughter and I am worried about her too. I don’t want my daughter to be left without parents. She doesn’t understand what is going on and it’s hard to explain because she’s only two so she doesn’t know why she can’t see her family members that she loves.,7,Sadness,5,5,6,7,8,1,2,6,I have lost hope at this point. At the beginning I was hopeful but now this pandemic just seems endless and I can’t imagine having my old life and freedoms back atm for another year at least. I am sad that what I thought would be a short isolation has escalated. I feel the UK government could’ve done more to protect us by closing borders like new zealand or australia and we could have had more freedom and our lives back by now. I only hope the vaccines will help us to get back to more normality as I am very hopeless at the moment and have lost all motivation.
498,7,Sadness,7,7,5,5,8,3,4,1,"I feel as though this situation is not being taken as seriously as it should be, there appear to be people who are continuing on with their lives as normal with disregard to the rules. This may be due to a lack of personal empathy or education, or simply because they didn't feel the government restrictions were clear enough. Some people don't seem to understand the importance of staying at home, and social distancing as they have not been made aware of asymptotic carriers of the virus. This causes me to become frustrated, and saddened for the NHS and other key workers who are risking their lives.  ",5,Sadness,7,7,5,3,7,5,3,1,"I feel that it is never ending, and that our government floundered so much at the beginning, it feels like it will go on forever. I am glad that vaccines have now been approved and are being dispensed. But again, if they run out or it transpires that they're ineffective, again where does that leave the country. It is frustrating and frightening. So many lives have been lost, time wasted, money wasted it's ridiculous to think that the government keep getting away with the horrendous way that this has been handled. "

This is because I've finished work for the day (and I'm very thankful to still be working from home, as I did prior to the pandemic, as it gives me a purpose during the weekdays) and I've been for a walk which cleared my head. I am of course worried about a lot of things to do with the virus but right now, including the health of my family and what the socioeconomic impact to the UK and the whole world will be. But right now I can see the bigger picture that it will pass, that this is an experience which we have to ride, and we will return to normal at some point hopefully this year.",3,Happiness,1,1,2,4,3,7,6,5,"I feel concerned but less than I did. I had a rough few months last year feeling really sad and anxious about everything going on, but The concern that I did have is outweighed now by being excited and optimistic for the next few months. I can't wait to see my family and friends again and for things to get back to normal. I've had a good couple of months because I bought my first home and that has kept me very busy, which I'm incredibly grateful for.
I'm also really impressed at how quickly the vaccines are being rolled out and I'm pleased that my parents are having theirs soon."

I am a student radiographer about to go into emergency practice and my wife is a midwife.  We are having to manage childcare between us and it really angers me to see some people not heeding the government advice about social distancing etc.  I do hope we can make it through this, but I think the UK is going to follow the same route as Italy and I think lots more people are going to die.  I am also very angry at China and really feel something needs to change in the way China conducts it's business in the future.",4,Sadness,6,5,4,6,8,3,4,2,"I think the main thing I feel with COVID at the moment is fatigue.  I work in healthcare and it has been one incredibly long slog to get to this point.  I also feel an enormous sense of trepidation and uncertainty about the coming months, as healthcare workers will continue to have to work extremely hard to deal with the backlog of care caused by COVID while the rest of the world will go back to normal.  I worry that the sacrifices and struggles of me and my colleagues will be forgotten as the rest of the world gets back to normal."

However I also feel guilty about feeling sad, as I know I am very lucky as I have a job, I am working so that fills my time, I have a roof over my head, space to exercise, and nice people around me. 

I have not yet known anyone to who has had coronavirus to any level of severity, and I am worried about when this will happen and who it will be. I am worried about my friends who have lost their jobs. I am worried about my relationship. I am worried about the economy. ",4,Anxiety,7,7,5,7,9,4,4,6,"I feel much more resigned and pessimistic. I don't feel excited about things reopening. I feel anxious about readjusting to a more normal life. I feel tired even though I do nothing. I fear we will be back in lockdown by winter again. The government has failed absolutely everyone and has relied on people's goodwill for too long. I worry coronavirus is just the beginning and we will experience many more pandemics and the government will have learned nothing. I worry about the long term effects this will have on everything, how people's personalities and course of their lives has been altered by this."
502,7,Anxiety,6,4,7,9,6,1,1,1,"I feel very anxious about the situation, due to the uncertainty of the extent of it. I feel we won’t know the full extent until people abide by the lockdown rules, so I am fearful of the full effects on the most vulnerable! It’s hard to comprehend but also it’s easy to stay inside unless essential, in order to help reduce the pressure On the NHS and reduce the spread. It’s very hard not seeing family and friends, especially as it’s unknown how long we won’t see them for! The corona situation is showing how strong we are but also that we need to help others around us!",7,Anxiety,7,6,8,8,6,3,3,3,"I am happy things may be looking more positive however I am worried to come out of ‘lockdown’. I feel that more things need to be in place. I feel that the government haven’t done enough, people are not valued enough such as the NHS. I am disgusted by how many people we have lost, it makes me so upset! I want to be able to see the people I care about however I am still worried it’s not safe, I miss socialising but I also don’t want to move too fast in going back to ‘normality’. I also feel like what we feel is normal has changed drastically since covid, who knows what’s a normal way to act anymore. "
503,2,Relaxation,1,1,2,3,1,3,5,4,"I feel like it is under control and that the correct measures have been put in place by the government. Although the social distancing measures are annoying, it will be worth it as it will reduce the number of new cases and means life can get back to normal quicker. Staying at home is getting boring although allows time to develop as a person such as; doing more exercise, learning a new skill. 

I am annoyed at people ignoring the social distancing measures as it is selfish and annoying for the people who listen to the rules. If everyone stayed at home we could deal with covid quicker.",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,3,5,6,8,"Hopeful but also fed up. Things are looking good with the vaccine role out but lockdown fatigue is dragging. I’m excited for things to start opening up again, but equally frustrated that some nations within the uk haven’t published dates or data for when things will actually open up. I hope this is the last lockdown we will ever have to have and don’t think our country can survive another one, due to the mental and economic impact. I would be fine with mask wearing and social distancing but otherwise would be frustrated with other lockdowns. It’s embarrassing that the UK as an island, has such a poor record with COVID compared to other counties such as Australia and New Zealand. I am also a bit worried these variants could put us back to square one if we allow them spread through the nation and the vaccines don’t protect us from them. "
504,8,Anger,5,4,2,1,1,5,7,1,I am shocked more than anything that a % of society are showing arrogance in helping to eradicate the virus by doing as they please. I feel personally calm as I am abiding by all guidelines; however my frustration comes into play due to the fact that I am a self-employed individual who has now lost all income. Seeing people not listening to government advice is not helping the country get back to a reasonable state of normality. We need businesses to trade and the economy to start moving again. It's a worrying time for all businesses regardless of size.,3,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,5,"As a business owner, I feel tense and nervous for the economical times ahead.

I hope that we can soon overcome this awful situation and that the world returns to normal.",5,Sadness,3,4,2,4,4,7,1,1,"I am sad that the situation has gone on for so long. My main reason for feeling this way is due to having a young child who has now missed out on a year of her life not being able to go out and do fun things such as going to the zoo, aquarium, etc. I am excited for the world to get back to normal so we can begin to do fun things again.
I am also worried about how the economy will bounce back from the huge financial hit its taken. 
I am hopeful that the government's latest roadmap will help us out of lockdown, hoping that we dont see another rise in cases when things start to reopen. 
I am excited to be able to enjoy summer with my family and friends, who I have barely seen over the last year.
The first lockdown enabled me to spend precious time at home with my family.
I am still working from home and have been since the start of the first lockdown. I dont expect that to change any time soon, and am quite enjoying it."

I feel anxious as I don’t know when it is going to end, and helpless as I feel I can’t help much in these uncertain times. They are unprecedented times, and no one really 100% know what’s going to happen in the long run.

It’s uncertain times and uncertain future, and for the population as a whole. I hope that we can get back on track and get back to normality sooner rather than later"

Surprisingly I think I have adapted to these new living restrictions quite quickly, the shock has worn off a little and the lockdown measures seem to be being accepted quite readily which gives me some confidence that we will get through this ok ",6,Relaxation,2,1,3,4,1,5,7,1,I have recently had my first vaccination jab and so I guess I am feeling hopeful. I feel good about the road map set out to release us from lockdown and get back to normal. I still feel a little anxiety for my friends and relatives that have not had their vaccine yet and for those that haven’t had it but the country starts opening up more as this will put them at more risk. I am slightly fearful of the new strains and whether the vaccine will protect against them and if not whether I will have to have further vaccines when they develop them.but I am still very  hopeful that we are on our way out of the pandemic this year.

I think that the government should not be treating the country all together as a whole as there are obviously differences between what steps need to be undertaken by people in large cities such as London as opposed to people living in rural Scotland.  I think there is too much ambiguity about what citizens can and can't do and the fact that some people seem to be swanning around and behaving as normal is galling to others who are following the governments rules to the letter.,5,Sadness,1,1,4,3,6,1,2,1,I am feeling a bit frustrated and sad about the amount of time that the virus seems to be lingering and affecting our lives.  I do feel the the end is in site though and that within a couple of months we will back to some sort of normal life.  Its the simple things like having a haircut and being able to go shopping which seem to be so tantalisingly near but still seem so far away. Just really hoping that there are no further setbacks and that we will not be disappointed by having further restrictions.

I feel as if my life is paused during the lockdown, and though it is peaceful here, there is an undercurrent of anger and fear from everyone I see when exercising or going to the shop.  I worry about my family and friends and feel somewhat isolated from everything.  I miss my job, not only for having something to do, but interacting with people normally.",9,Fear,2,5,8,6,6,1,1,1,"I feel that getting everyone vaccinated is paramount now, and that governments need to cooperate to make medicines available to all.  Locally, there is a low rate of coronavirus at the moment but I also feel there is a lot of complacency which makes further outbreaks inevitable.

I feel that the UK situation as a whole is improving but considering it has been dire for the last few months it's not a great improvement.

It is difficult to keep them entertained in one room all day. I went to town for the first time on Sunday to buy cat food and found it very scary. There seemed to be more people with mental issues in the streets and much fewer other people to ask for help if there were problems. Most of the shops are shut and there’s no access to public toilets. People who are out do not respect the 2m rule and others and abuse the staff who are trying to enforce them. I am scared to go into town where usually we would spend most of the day there before. When I got home my anxiety and fear was so bad I felt I couldn’t breathe or think and I don’t usually suffer with anxiety. Now we go for exercise before 6am because we don’t trust people and if we have to shop we try to be home by 8:30am and we go to local shops and not the supermarkets. The queuing system is terrifying and full of people coughing and smoking and grouching about the stupid rules. I do not want to queue to potentially catch something that kills me or my family. Shops say one family member only and forget that we can’t leave our children outside alone, and that to buy a weeks shopping is often not possible. We have four cats, three children and no car. The cat food weighs 10kg for a week. The litter weighs 3kg. Milk for all of us is 30litres. I’m pushing a double buggy with 20kg of children in already, how do I carry everything? We can’t get home delivery, there are no slots and we’re not vulnerable. Shopping every second day is the least we can get away with at the moment. That means we have a higher chance of meeting the virus. ",5,Anger,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,1,"I’m angry that people still aren’t taking things seriously. I worry that the new mutations will be resistant to the vaccine and we’ll have to start developing another and we’ll be no better than this time last year. I feel that our education system has failed us when people give more weight to Facebook opinions than to science, purely because science is too hard to understand so it must be fake. And it seems like the government puts more value in whether they’re liked than they do in making competent and consistent decisions. "

i certainly don't want to die like that and then to some health care workers who live on my street flouting the rules is a disgrace

Upset for all victims.  Anxiety about leaving the house to shop as no idea if you will be able to get what you need.
Huge anger towards bosses of big companies that furlough staff and then come begging for state handouts (Philip Green!).
Sad about social media as too many bullies on there",2,Anger,7,6,2,6,3,4,4,2,"I feel angry at the government spunking billions on their tory mates for things like track and trace which still doesn't work properly.  The vaccination programme is going well and run by the NHS, so it just pisses me off that they outsource things to mates and it turns out to be shit.  This government has basically stolen our money and given it to their mates.

You just don't know what may happen next and our family has a newborn baby. Its sad not even able to go and visit as we had planned. Happy that family well so not all bad. Relieved shops not as chaotic as they were. Although seeing more emotional flareups than we usually do. In balance have a good feeling of community support. See that on thursday clap for the cares and support staff that continue to work. More good than bad people. Just wish was back to normal.,3,Relaxation,1,1,3,3,2,4,4,7,Not as relaxed as I was for the first lockdown. We are not affected as a family but know extended family members been treated and as luck has it survived the experience. Not being able to enjoy the normal festive Christmas was very hard to deal with. Not a great party person but family means a lot to us. So felt frustrated with not knowing till last moment it seemed we would be able to actually meet as a group. We did get to see son which was great. Outside and within the guide lines. At least now can look forward to the summer relaxation. However still worry about what will happen next winter. Can only hope not as bad.

I'm annoyed and frustrated that some people are still not obeying the lockdown rules, such as those sitting on benches drinking or hanging out in parks, and also annoyed that the government didn't act sooner.",4,Happiness,1,1,2,3,1,8,7,1,"Overall I don't feel too bad about the situation now.  I'm slightly concerned about the virus still spreading around, due to people not following the rules and that behaviour is still annoying me but I'm not stressing about things.  The new variants are worrying but I think they will quickly get under control.  There is always the niggling thought that other people or lack of government planning will set us back.

Im also worried that governments will push through all manner of draconian measures on the back of this once things calm down.",6,Anger,7,5,4,4,8,2,4,1,I feel angry that we have been deprived of so much for something that was not our fault. People are so afraid of dying of something that has a very high survival rate that they have forgotten what it means to truly live and are all too happy to give up their freedom and liberty. I feel worried that our government is mismanaged the  situation and is going to eventually force us to have a vaccine that I fear has not been fully tested and despite all this the lockdowns will continue and people will lose livelihoods.

I think it’s important that people follow government advice as it will allow this to be over sooner and it disgusts me that some don’t seem to be listening. I pray that this all ends soon and that life can go back to normal but I also want to make sure I use this time wisely and don’t fall out of a routine,3,Desire,3,2,3,6,6,4,3,8,"I feel like my life is on hold, I’m neither happy or sad, just feel like every day is the same and that life just involves existing at the moment. I think the best way to describe it is being in limbo, I still have things to do however motivation is lacking as things don’t seem as real as they normally would. I am hopeful for what is to come though and looking forward for life to return to normal. I know that when things do return to normal I will be excited and will want to make the best of every moment and so I am using this to motivate me to do work and complete tasks whilst that option is not possible so I have more time to enjoy it when it does happen.

I miss my family so much and I worry for them
I'm so proud of my NHS working daughter but so worried for her safety
It is an alien situation. I am proud of my elderly parents who seem to be managing better than I am.
I am fearful when I leave the house and am paranoid not to come into contact with anyone. I take antibacterial wipes everywhere and constantly wipe surfaces and my hands
I feel helpless for my family and I am fighting not to be redeployed frontline with my nhs job",7,Anxiety,4,1,6,9,7,2,2,2,"I feel very sad that the Pandemic has aged my parents. They are in their 80's and have become very dependent due to health conditions compounded by CORONA. Because of the need to shield, limited physical activity and comfort eating has worsened their diabetes and they have lost their physical stamina. 
We are saddened to have all missed so much of our young grandchildren's development and worry they may have forgotten how to hug.
Working remotely finds me exhausted when I do have to leave the house for shopping etc.
Suffer a great deal from anxiety about weight gain and appearance.
Personal relationships have been troublesome at times due to lockdown. 
Fear for things returning to 'normal' - how will i cope? "
519,9,Fear,7,5,9,8,9,2,2,1,"I'm extremely anxious and concerned about the current situation in the UK regarding the Coronavirus. Some people just don't seem to understand what staying home is and what the implications of them staying out sunbathing in a park or visiting their mates are. People are stupid and inconsiderate and it's a very tough feeling because you're stuck at home feeling helpless and waiting for this all to pass. Also, I am in panic every time I go to the shops and see there's a lot of things missing in the shelves. I'm also extremely concerned about my work and the livelihood of my job as so many people are being made redundant or are being furloughed. This has resulted in some sleepless nights.",8,Anxiety,5,3,8,9,8,3,2,2,"Despite the UK vaccinating over 22 million of the population, Coronavirus is still a very real thing as we're still having thousands of people infected and hundreds dying every day. I was fortunate enough to receive my first dose of the shot 2 weeks ago (I was not expecting it at all). I took the opportunity of course. That doesn't mean that I'm relaxing or being less careful. We have had a number of cases within my place of work so it's still very much present and closer than ever. I suffer from chronic asthma so have to be very attentive."
520,5,Sadness,3,6,2,2,7,2,1,1,"I just feel like it is spreading way too fast, as I work in a supermarket, I have to walk past people in a daily basis despite lockdown. 

I would be much happier if more people followed the lockdown advice given by the government. I still keep seeing people sitting on their street drinking beer and not having a care in the world. 

People seem to go from being mildly ill one day to requiring hospital treatment the next day. 

I hope the vaccine for Cov is ready sooner than the predicted timeline of 18 months. Too many people have already died from it. ",6,Anxiety,2,3,3,6,4,5,3,3,"Back in September i was made redundant, now I worry about the future for me and my kids as there are very few available job opportunities and to more and more people with much better qualifications than me applying for any job they can in order to make ends meet. I think at the moment i feel like a bit of a failure, i know being made redundant was beyond my control as it was due to a company breakdown due to Covid-19. There is still the feeling in my head that I should be in work again by now but it doesn't seem to matter what I apply for, replies to my application are never given. 
As for my feelings towards C-19 as a whole, i am fed up of lockdowns, tier lists, shop closures and school closures. I have been fully supportive of all the measures taken so far and follow the guidance whenever I can. I find myself getting really annoyed and angry when I see groups of people in the street or walk past a house that is having a party. I honestly blame these people for making this situation drag on as long as it has done. The reason i am so fed up of the measures now is my general feeling towards these people that break the rules, thoughts going around in my head such as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Why should i follow guidance to protect those that aren't willing to protect their selves and instead put other people at risk."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Well, I will continue to follow the guidance in hope that these people don't completely ruin our efforts. Not for myself or those that won't give the same curtesy but for those that are vulnerable.

I’m not stressed at all, but I do feel very bad for those who have been affected and scared for my elder family members. I feel more patriotic as it shows the whole country coming together but it angers me that some people think it’s okay for them to ignore the social distancing rules set by the government, these people aren’t above anyone else and they should face consequences.",2,Anxiety,3,2,1,7,8,3,7,3,"i feel upset that i’ve missed of most of my younger adult years and i feel extremely lonely and miss my family and friends.

I don't worry too much about getting the virus but I worry that my parents might. I think the future economic problems will be very bad though and we don't know quite how bad yet. I feel quite constricted, on the news they have lots of items about people ignoring the social distancing rules or being fined and I worry that the government will ban all outdoor exercise and I'll be even more constricted. I think people are getting overly angry at these """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bad"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" people in society because there's nothing else for them to get angry at really and that worries me. Most of the people dying now will have caught the virus before the country went into lockdown so I feel their anger is misplaced.

I'm quite scared by how many conspiracy theories there are and how many people I know who don't want to take the vaccine (although none are in the UK).

I have already lost one vulnerable relative to coronavirus and have many elderly relatives and vulnerable friends. I feel some anger at the inadequate and delayed Government response to the virus. I am anxious about the economic and social consequences of the pandemic with one daughter furloughed with her job at risk and another trying to follow a degree course through online working with no university contact. I am also concerned that a small number of individuals are not following guidelines for social distancing.,7,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,8,9,5,"Slightly less concerned personally because of vaccination but worried that we are again coming out of lockdown too early. Government has lacked a strategy throughout and I fear that we will return to lockdown in the Autumn if not before.

I feel particularly frustrated for NHS staff who have been badly treated throughout the pandemic."

The fact that there is not an end date insight does contribute to a less positive outlook within day to day life and yet again creates a sense of anxiety. I also feel a sense of frustration seeing other citizens being unable to follow government advice when it comes to social distancing.  ",4,Disgust,5,6,4,7,6,4,4,4,"At the moment I just feel fed up of the current conditions, I just think it has gone on for too long and things are only slightly getting better. It’s frustrating also missing out on crucial experiences in uni and also being unable to work. Life is feeling very mundane and it is hard to see anything improving in the future. It’s hard to feel positive without having anything to definitely look forward to in the near future, a feeling that has been felt for a long time by many people. It’s also a worry when the government are also so incompetent and deaths are disgusting ly high, something that could of 100% been prevented"
525,4,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,6,9,6,"I think all happening around the coronavirus is very exaggerated. Information is normally given without any reference so that it is not possible to evaluate the numbers. Too much pressure is done to make people afraid of something, to stay at home and close businesses. All media tell only horrors about the situation instead of sharing improvements. It is clear that it is easier to manage mass when they are scared. Overall I think that this is an artificial virus created by a human being to win an economic war on the planet. ",3,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,7,9,5,"I am confident that the corona is fake. The whole year different stories have been told. Some of them are more fake than others. Looks they lost control over it and try to escape through finishing it. While vaccination is shown as relief, it brings restrictions to the people rights in particular in poor countries. No syncronisation in the information is seen that adds much confusion and disappointment. I would not make any vaccines at all but it looks they will force people to go for it without any choice "
526,6,Anxiety,4,1,5,9,6,1,1,1,"Initially I didn’t realise how serious this was. I thought it was like the flu and didn’t understand why everyone was talking about it so much. I now realise it is serious and it makes me very anxious. I am worried for my children. I am worried for my parents, especially because my mother is having to isolate for 12 weeks. I am missing her. I don’t like the streets being quiet and shops having queues. It is necessary and that’s fine. But it’s all so different and it’s not knowing when it will end that scares me. I just want people to listen to advice and it’ll all be over quicker. ",4,Anxiety,2,1,3,7,6,4,4,4,"I feel very anxious about the corona situation in that I just want life to return to normal. When it all first happened last March, it was new and unfamiliar. Communities came together, less traffic was on the roads, the weather was lovely. But now, it’s been too long, people have lost their jobs, children have missed so much schooling, and a lot of people I believe, have had enough. Me included. I want to be able to go to the cinema, to meet my friends for a coffee and lunch, I don’t want to wear a mask anymore. I get so sad when I think about elderly and vulnerable people all alone or poorly. I want to help them. And each time the government mentions new measures, such as easing ,lockdown, I worry that we will all build our hopes up only to have them shattered. What if we come out of lockdown too soon and we’ll have to go back in it again? I feel anxious all the time worrying, please everyone, stick to the rules, let’s get out of this situation "
527,6,Anxiety,4,5,5,7,6,5,5,4,"I feel the situation has escalated due to the government acting slowly on information that was available in January but ignored, as a result we now have unnecessary deaths and illnesses to a large % of people. If this was acted upon at the time I feel we could have prevented the scale of this and reduced the effect it has had on the economy with workers being made redundant. As a result people are now scared and nervous to even leave the house, and everyone panic buying, leaving a number of people struggling to get basic supplies.",6,Anxiety,6,5,6,8,6,4,3,4,"I am increasingly anxious as the economy begins to reopen, and with new variants, I worry about a 3rd spike, as seems to be starting elsewhere in Europe. I think the vaccine will obviously help, but there's not enough evidence to support how effective it can be to the new variants in my opinion and I think people that get the vaccine could become more reckless and start to waver from the rules and restrictions. With parts of France currently about to go into another lockdown, and with summer approaching, I fear winter could return to parts of the country and economy being locked back down again"

I’m sad. I miss my friends. I miss having a hug. 

I’m currently classed as a part-time key worker in a supermarket, but customers aren’t completely adhering to the social distancing rules and it gets me very nervous. I can’t afford to not work. I fear for my family, and should anyone get ill, would it be my fault? 

I suffer from a few chronic conditions myself, so I’m not entirely sure how I would even survive the virus to be honest. I’m previously diagnosed with contamination/health OCD, so I’m pretty impressed with how I’m handling things so far. ",6,Anxiety,3,3,5,7,6,6,5,5,"I’m anxious about the post covid world. Money worries. The vaccine has given us hope, but I do think people are going to be too relaxed and we are likely to go back into a lockdown. I can’t have that anymore. I’m lonely. I live in a family home that isn’t particularly supportive, I just really miss my friends, and hugs. I’m hopeful we’re on the way out. I’m a social butterfly and to get me through I’m working 2 jobs, I can’t stay home and do nothing. It’s been happening for too long now, I won’t take things for granted as much after covid. "

Angry that the government has mismanaged this so badly we are still in lockdown a year after the pandemic started. So many lives have been lost unnecessarily that it is hard to comprehend the loss so many people have felt.

Desperate to get this over and done with so we can return to normal  life. The people just need to stick with the guidelines for another few months and we have every chance of beating this.

Im also concerned for my job as the business I work for is affected by Corona due to falling sales due to the lockdown the country is currently operating under.

I am also disappointed/angry at how badly our UK government dealt with the xmas holiday period, as in not locking down properly, as this has caused, in my view, around additional 20,000 deaths (which could easily of been avoided) and lengthened our lock down period in the UK by, again in my view, 2 to 3 months."

The vaccination programme is powering ahead but with only one shot, and the second not within the manufacturers’ timeframes, who knows what the final efficacy will be.

I am finding staying at home to be quite easy because the stakes are so high. I find being alone suits me and it’s the right thing to do.

I’m also a keyworker so work life goes on fairly similar, although our services are dramatically reduced to emergency work only. People in work are quite stressed and this can breed further anxieties in the office. 
I have two young children so my main concern Is their wealth fair and making sure I can protect them ",3,Relaxation,2,2,2,2,3,4,7,3,"Overall I currently feel cautious optimism regarding Covid-19 mainly due to the improvement in deaths and cases combined with new vaccines being introduced.

So why not let open everything up? More than 20 million have been vaccinated. The chances of you catching it, and even dying now is slim as long as you're normal and healthy.

It makes me really sad and it also angers me that I can’t do anything for them to help them. I fear for my mental health, I fear that this is now going to deteriorate as I’ve recently moved areas and I don’t know when I’ll be able to get treatment again. ",7,Anxiety,6,2,7,9,6,4,1,5,"I feel so frustrsted, I want things to go back to normal. Majority of the population have now been vaccinated so I really do not understand why we are still living like this. I hate living in this way it makes me so sad. I think the government need to be honest as I feel we are all being strung along. I have noticed my own mental health has deteriorated during this pandemic. My work has also suffered. Everything has been hit hard. It is difficult at the moment to imagine that we will ever be normal. It really affects me with other people in terms of personal space."

I have family members who are key workers in the NHS and working around the virus every day. I worry about them, friends or other family getting the virus as it looks to be very serious. I also worry about the possibilities of myself having the virus at any time. 
As I am so worried I am quite tense and unable to relax. This means I am fidgeting and looking for ways to use up some energy, I don't feel particularly happy and am starting to feel a little bit sad, ",6,Sadness,2,2,5,6,7,4,4,2,"Although I'm tired and a bit fed up with lockdown, I'm starting to feel hopeful as restrictions are slowly easing and a few people I know have already had one or both doses of their vaccine. I don't want to get my hopes up too much as there are still many risks and things could change. It's also worth thinking about how on a global scale many people are still suffering - so I am still anxious to some extent. 
There's also the ongoing worry that at some point I could get Covid-19 and transmit it to someone else - most people my age have not had their vaccine so I don't want to cause anyone to be unwell. I hope that overtime these worries will calm down as things (hopefully) improve. "
568,2,Sadness,6,1,2,2,7,2,3,1,"I feel saddened at the number of deaths of NHS workers who have not been adequately supplied with PPE, these deaths are preventable and should never have occurred if they were given the right equipment to do their job safely. And that only recently they are being tested. 

I also feel for those who are dying not of covid but as a result, those who surgery been cancelled or those in too much fear to attend A&E with life threatening symptoms

I'm angry that we were slow of the mark, lockdown should have occurred sooner and more tests carried as well as contact tracing.",2,Sadness,1,6,1,1,7,5,5,5,"disgust with government and how the whole situation has been handled. ranging from the slow to react back last feb/ march, failure to close borders, the handing of contracts to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""friends"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of torries without competition,  the waste of tax payers money on pep contract that failed to materialise and then recently say there is no money to give NHS staff a decent pay rise. the failure of private companies ie track and trace, the failure to pursue a zero covid policy last year.
But sadness for those who have unnecessarily died, those who didn't qualify for financial help "

I feel that the government are not in a position to answer many of these unknowns which is a contributing factor to anxieties. I am personally feeling very unmotivated in my day to day living. I feel it is difficult to maintain a routine with changes to work patterns etc which is having an impact on my mental health. I do not personally feel at high risk if I was the get coronavirus but I feel many people who are in the high risk category are being complacent in their daily actions which could result in them becoming seriously ill.,3,Anxiety,3,4,6,6,4,6,6,6,"I feel it could have been handled better - frustrated with the government’s mixed messaging. They continuously praise key workers yet no real reward given for the hard work they have done during the pandemic. Feel that everyone is in limbo. Quite frustrated and not sure if this will be the last time that we have to put our lives on hold. Worried about getting ‘back to normal’ and that it will be a new normal, such as quieter high streets as many shops have gone bust. Also public services being unable to operate in the normal way, such as face-to-face work with service users. "

I purposefully only read the news online in the mornings then avoid it for the rest of the day (by not watching tv, not going on Facebook but rather just Instagram and YouTube). When I think about the future, the health of my family, the security of our jobs and the economy etc I can get worries and I am worried by the fact there is no end date to lockdown as of yet and also when lockdown is lifted, how can we be sure to keep ourselves fit and healthy? But day to day I am pragmatic - I take each day as it comes and at the moment I am enjoying taking this time to do some DIY and odd jobs around the house. This keeps me busy and my mind off the situation.",4,Desire,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,4,"I feel hopeful about the corona situation - things are looking up but I am still mindful that we are not past the finish line yet. I can get sad when I think of how long we have to wait to see friends and be able to travel again but if I focus on one day at a time it is not something that concerns me or makes me feel anxious. Somedays I enjoy the slower pace of life but others I long for life to resume as 'normal'.

At this moment, I am relaxed and have had a good day of work to distract me. I have also spent some of the day imagining what I will do when restrictions are lifted (I keep a list of my ideas). I am currently content and optimistic for the future."

I'm worried about my older family getting the virus and how badly it would effect them, also their mental health as they're not used to being on their own for any time at all.  Also I'm worried how the economy will be impacted as a result of the lockdown as well as this coinciding with brexit.

I'm worried about the government putting us into lockdown again after the summer and the impact it will have on small businesses once again.  I strongly feel that once the people at risk of serious illness have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated and enough time has passed to where the vaccination is effective that the country should completely reopen and corona safety guidelines should be optional.

There is still no face masks for general public since the WHO started to say it is useful for protecting lives from the coronavirus. If the government said that because there is not enough masks available, they can build more factorys to produce tons of masks for everybody use. Please stop risking the public. If not using masks for general public, I don't think you can stop the coronavirus spreading between people. it will become a deadly bug forever.",8,Fear,3,4,7,7,3,4,7,5,"I feel unsafe to get out of my home as I can see lots of people are not wearing face covering on the street or outdoor. For indoor, there are still some people are not wearing face coverings. Also, I don't think the covid vaccine will work against new variants. So it is not worth to get the jab now. I prefer to wait for the new oral drugs and medicines in my opinions. I am very opposed to the vaccine passport because it is meaningless as the virus can still transmit after you get the vaccine. Also, it may not protect people from new variants. So I prefer to wear face covering instead as it can prevent the virus getting into the body whichever the variant is."

I long for this to be over honestly but I know that can only happen with the hard work of our health services and whatnot. However, I am extremely angry at our government's handling of the situation (e.g lack of PPE for frontline staff), I think the lack of preparation was very irresponsible and thus I am a little disgusted by it.

I am stressed as I have been juggling looking after my daughter, my 2 school aged children who are at home and my toddler. My husband is a key worker and is still out working, leaving me at home. My 2 school aged children are being home schooled requiring help and supervision.
Lockdown is hard with children keeping them amused, active and engaged.",4,Relaxation,2,1,1,3,2,6,7,3,"I am much more comfortable and relaxed about the corona situation right now. Cases are down & the vaccine rollout has been successful and at pace. My children go back to school the week after next which will give us all more normality.

My disabled daughter will receive her vaccine very shortly, as will I as her carer. This too is a big relief.  My older relatives each have received one dose of the vaccine while my grandmother now has had 2 doses.

I'm appreciating how much freedom we had before this lockdown but everyone just took it for granted. Now people are getting outside and enjoying exercising. Suddenly things seem so much more appealing when you know you're not supposed to be doing them.",1,Sadness,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,"I feel so very tired of it all. It seems as though it'd never going to end even though a huge number of people have been vaccinated. I worry for the economy and small businesses.

They are talking about a third wave coming.i really feel that if they open everything back up only to ose it again it is going to tip some people right over the edge. People have had enough! "

What is more concerning is that it is very clear that worldwide Governments contingencies are woefully inadequate to deal with such incidents. 
The UK in particular has fallen woefully short on testing capability.

Am I scared of Corona, no
Do I worry about Corona affecting me/family, no
Am i concerned about the death rate, no",2,Sadness,1,1,1,1,7,3,6,2,"I'm not too concerned about the pandemic as I consider myself low risk. Take away the emotive side of it and statistically I have nothing to fear and very little to worry about. I don't personally know anyone who has caught it or died from it and believe that the press reporting of it is atrocious by spreading fear and anxiety into certain age groups which shouldn't have happened. The Government response has been mixed, but the way the UK is dealing with vaccinations proves that leaving the EU was a step forward as the EU have made a complete mess of their vaccination program. Apart from the leisure side of life my life has remained very normal with being out regularly and going to work daily."

Life has completely changed and we don’t know long for, so we are also concerned about mental health. My parents have underlying health conditions, so if they caught it then there’s a good chance it could get serious. There is also a worry for the economy and potential job losses.

People do not follow the rules correctly and as such we keep having periods of lockdown followed by gradual easing then we have to go back into lockdown again. There is a strong argument that herd immunity was probably going to be the best way forward and I strongly feel that the issues we still have may well have now all but been resolved. In the area I live in we have been locked down due to the initial tiering system and then the national lockdown for nearly 5 months now and it starting to really get me down. The things I enjoy doing with my family have gone. Holidays abroad, eating out, taking the kids for something fun to do all have gone for now. Yes there is a small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel and my wife and me have both received our 1st jabs. 3 things I want to happen. Firstly some sort of immunisation passport so we can be free to move within this county and abroad. Secondly just open everything up again, people do not follow the rules so it is pointless keep locking down then easing repeatedly and thirdly keep pressing on full steam ahead with the vacination program. Anyone who chooses not to have it can stay at home and stew as far as I am concerned."

I would have preferred to have a small Christmas celebration and leas restrictions are this time such as the restaurants and shops being open.

I am also relieved that I won’t have to spend another birthday in lockdown! "
617,8,Anxiety,5,4,7,8,6,3,4,1,"I fear the situation mostly because of the large parts of the population (not just in the UK) that are not taking it seriously, as their actions threaten the survival of vulnerable people in the population. It is increasingly dangerous that some people do not listen to scientists, and I fear the lack of control that we have. I hope that better things come out of this. I also feel that mental health is taking a hit as people stay confined; I personally am lucky that I managed to join my family before lockdown hit, as otherwise I would be in a very bad place. ",7,Anxiety,6,3,7,8,7,2,4,1,"I feel sad that it has been such a long time, and we are still stuck in the pandemic. It is upsetting that the handling of the situation by the government has led to so many deaths, and the requirement of a second lockdown. I wish that we had stuck with a strict lockdown for longer, to be in a better position than we currently are in. I have some hope for the vaccine, but also am used to the hope being squished by new issues, so I am reluctant to believe an end is in sight. Additionally, I am upset about the things coronavirus has cost us, both in lives and in how I have experienced life as a Masters Student"
618,8,Anxiety,5,5,7,8,8,2,3,1,"I feel anxious whenever I leave my home to get food supplies. I feel sad and upset at the amount of lives being lost both here in the UK and across the world. I feel anger towards the members of the population that continue to go out and do as they please whilst the rest of us are trying to keep to the rules. I feel annoyed at the government for not giving us stricter rules. South Korea have done what everyone should do. They never had a vicious peak like we are having. I just want us all safe and well, I want this all to be over.",7,Anxiety,1,1,4,5,5,1,1,1,even though the figures of new cases and deaths are coming down daily I still feel anxious surrounding being near other people. I am happy that lots of the older and at risk members of the public have now had their first vaccine. I am uneasy about the figures rising again once the schools re open on Monday. Hopefully the new cases will continue to fall and the shops will be allowed to re open and this awful virus is starting to fade away. Life getting back to normal is what everyone wants but I do feel that maybe the shops re opening in April is going to be pushed back a few weeks to make sure we are all safe. Our lives are more important than the economy but I do understand that the economy is extremely important for our country too.
619,7,Relaxation,2,3,6,4,7,5,8,4,"I feel hopeful. There is still a long way to go but I am less anxious than I was. I am also feeling sombre and sad for all those that have died. I also feel a sense of duty in following the government rules and to keep going through this challenging time. I also feel grateful to all those on the front line, nhs staff, carers, supermarket workers, delivery drivers etc. I also feel glad I am able to work from home and stay safe. I feel like this is a life changing time of my life. I don't think we will ever face such a tough situation in my lifetime and feel like it will define us. ",4,Relaxation,3,3,2,3,4,3,5,4,"I am hopeful things will get better soon, with vaccination and infections coming down. But I am also tired and bored of lockdown. The winter months have been tough. I just want to be able to do things again and see family and friends. It feels like it's taking so long to get to that point. I feel I am getting impatient for things to get more normal. Each milestone the government has set out just seems so far away. I feel so lethargic and like I can't be bothered to do anything, even though I have more time. "
620,4,Anxiety,4,5,4,6,5,5,4,3,"I feel not too concerned, certainly not as concerned as I was. I am anxious for my sister who is on immunosuppressants and my dad who has an autoimmune disorder, but overall I do not feel that anxious. I feel guilty about saying it but there are some positives to the situation. I am a keyworker so I still have to travel into London to work and the trains are very empty so my journey has improved significantly which I am happy about, but I feel guilty that I am happy about that. Apart from this I feel anxious, a bit concerned, but not necessarily fearful.",4,Relaxation,1,1,2,4,2,5,7,2,"I feel mostly relaxed about the situation, not necessarily happy but just content with getting on with the current situation. I am a bit apprehensive about the future but not anxious or worried about it. The vaccine is a positive step in the right direction which relaxes me a bit. However I also feel that there is no point getting worried over something I can't control, either we will get COVID under control or we won't, I won't be able to change that so I won't worry about it. The only difficult thing I find is not being able to meet up with people in public places like for a drink after work so I am looking forward to coming out of lockdown."
621,2,Relaxation,2,1,3,2,2,8,8,7,"I feel sorry that people are dying from this and are having anxieties caused by it however for myself I'm really enjoying it. Everywhere is much more peaceful, the air is less polluted, the night sky is brighter, there's no noise at night, no airplanes in the sky. It's very much idyllic to myself. I took a stroll through the park the other morning and it was deserted. I don't have to waste my existence in pointless shops. About the only annoying thing is not having a place to take the kids but they're young enough they don't really mind",2,Relaxation,3,1,2,5,4,7,7,4,"I think frustration would be the overwhelming feeling right now; it would just be nice if it was finished with. It's a bit miserable being sat inside all the time not being able to go anywhere new or even anywhere old. My 18 month old daughter hasn't ever really experienced going out other than to nursery, she doesn't know any different so is fine but it's hard not to look at her and realise just how long this whole thing has dragged on. It would be nice to just have an actual end. I worry that in 6 months time as winter starts rolling back in we see some new 'variants' that the vaccines don't touch and we're back where we started. "
622,5,Sadness,5,4,4,4,6,3,4,4,Tired of being inside most of the time but making a routine and trying to get through it all. Looking forward to being able to socialise and band out with friends...whenever that is.  Feel sad for those who are passing too soon.  Feel proud to have the NHS but angry at the government for how shortsighted they have been given they’ve underfunded it and berated it but now want to applaud it.  Almost more worried about the US and how their government’s blind ignorance of science will affect their people.,5,Anxiety,8,1,3,8,8,2,1,1,The government have done nothing but jeopardise peoples health and safety whilst trying to save their own careers and line their friends pockets.  A lot more could have been done much earlier and we wouldn’t have so many deaths and our economy would have recovered much sooner.  After all that’s been done they still refuse to value the NHS offering pittance when they should be doing all the can to prevent the next pandemic by supporting our health service.           We are now the laughing stock of the world.
623,7,Relaxation,5,7,1,3,3,7,7,1,"It's a time to reflect on how bad the world has become and people are beginning to help each other. We an only hope that a vaccine is discovered soon and we have every faith in scientists to do so. I do hope this is over soon. I am trying to keep positive and look on the bright side, but in the back of my mind I am worried about catching the virus and dying from it. I am confined to my house and am not sad about this, in fact I am enjoying being at home and and being away from the rat race. I don't know what else to say really. I'm on medication for serious depression and anxiety and am feeling chilled out/zoned out most of the time.",9,Anxiety,3,1,9,9,8,5,5,1,"At the moment, I feel as though I am stuck, paralysed and inert. I do not leave my house and, I know this is odd, but I do not want to leave my house when lockdown ends. I am fearful. Fearful of the future. Not only are we dealing with the pandemic, but we are dealing with Brexit and an inept, corrupt Goverment. This is frightening. I am scared and I am anxious. Even though I will be getting the vaccine soon, I don't feel as though I will be safe. I lost my job last year due to redundancy and I cannot imagine how I will get back to work. I have very little money to live on. The future is bleak; I am tired all the time and I have terrible thoughts. "
624,3,Relaxation,1,2,3,1,3,5,5,4,"i am actually quite happy during lockdown. I've been doing all my jobs that need to be done. it is upsetting that so many people are dying, but I feel like I am numb to all these deaths. since it is not directly affecting me, I'm numb to it. i have been outside once during lockdown to go to the shops but I am lucky because I have a nice garden so I can go outside safely. me and my family are coping very well together and I feel like this experience will bring us closer together as a family. we have been getting along very well. we have done little projects, e.g my daughter made a TARDIS from Dr who",2,Relaxation,2,1,3,2,3,4,4,2,"I think we have gone from high fear and little cases to low fear but high cases. luckily I have not been personally affected so I do not have many strong personal emotions however my heart does go out to all those affected. even if they say death toll is down to 60 people a day, that is still 60 families everyday dealing with the loss of a loved one sooner than they should.
i think the government are doing what they can at the moment but should've handled it better at the start. I think they should delay the opening of  gyms and non-essential shops to try and reduce the spread since we still have thousands of cases a day. "
625,4,Sadness,6,4,5,5,8,5,4,2,I am concerned about the current COVID-19 pandemic but I’m also aware I am doing everything possible. I’m angered by people not following basic rules and the situation proving to be getting worse. I’m anxious for my friends who are in the higher risk categories and also for my job. I worry about when normal service will be resumed and how the country will recover afterwards. I am sad primarily due to the lack of human interaction although I am grateful for my house mate who makes things much happier.,4,Anxiety,6,3,5,8,7,2,3,1,"I feel exasperated. It’s been handled badly and people are getting to the point where they don’t care. The focus is on the economy, holidays and money which I understand but they’re rushing things and not making sure people are abiding by rules. It seems the country should’ve been harsher at the beginning and reopening too much cause the second wave. The rules aren’t clear and don’t cover enough instances. The fear is that more things will be open and people will rush out and we will be back to square one "
626,8,Anxiety,6,4,8,8,7,4,3,3,"I am just so worried. I am worried about my family that lives thousands of miles away, I am worried about my mother who lives on her own and still has to go to work. I am worried about my brother who was looking for work just before the crisis began. And I am worried when this will end - will we ever return to normal? Will we go on holiday again? We were so excited to celebrate my graduation this summer and now this won't happen. And any good news, personal and professional, is so rapidly forgotten because you can't celebrate it with anyone. ",8,Anxiety,4,3,7,8,5,4,3,4,"On the one hand, I am really glad that the vaccination programme is going so well in the UK. But I'm unsure whether even slow re-opening will lead to sufficiently low cases. I am just unsure if I will ever experience a normal time at university again, it all just feels so distant.

I am also worried that my family in Germany will have to wait ages for vaccines, which will not help me feel good about visiting them. I haven't seen them for 7 months now, and I just want to hug them again. The high number of anti-vaccers also really worries me. "
627,7,Sadness,3,4,2,8,9,1,1,1,"I miss my friends and family and being able to go out whenever, wherever, with whomever I want. I am sad that this has happened to the world and that so many people are suffering. I am so annoyed and angry at the people who keep flouting the government guidelines and making everyone else struggle for longer. It's unfair that they don't feel like they have to help anyone else when there are people trying to save lives. There's so much death. My mum has cancer and she's a very high risk person but she's been told she won't be able to get help if she gets the virus. Yet people who blatantly disregard the safety rules will probably be absolutely fine.",7,Anxiety,6,7,5,8,7,6,4,5,"I'm quite stressed about it all. I want it to be over so life can go back to how it was but I don't want to rush back to that state and put more people in danger. It's a delicate balance and it's hard to know what's best for everyone. I miss my friends and my family but I'd rather keep them safe than have them catch the virus and get seriously ill.
I'm also very sad that my university experience has been so disrupted and that I'm missing all of the practical work that was such a large part of why I wanted to go."
628,6,Anxiety,5,3,5,8,6,2,1,1,Currently feel mentally and physically drained - it’s caused really bad anxiety as it’s very unnerving not knowing if you or family will contract the virus and not being able to hug and see family is so difficult. Currently working at home but so hard to focus and have motivation to carry on with work based topics when partner is furloughed which is an financial strain and balancing boredom. Beginning of lockdown was excited to get things done in the house but also due to lockdown are unable to get any items in particular fence paint. I get really heightened anxiety at the thought of going food shopping during this time.,3,Sadness,6,5,2,4,8,1,2,4,I’m annoyed that We are still in the same situation as almost a year ago but if not worse where so many jobs have been lost and the support from the government has been poor. I’m fearful of what is to come and anxious that how it will impact us personally and nationally in the long term. I’m happy that there is some end in sight and a potential road map to getting out of it just really hoping we don’t go back into another lockdown after three different instances. I’m pleased we have a good vaccination programme in place and look forward to the day the majority of the population will be covered and the day we can go abroad once more but isn’t it funny how the UK recorded so little deaths from the flu this year it doesn’t seem to be accurate representation of what we have endured and how flu is still around no matter what!
629,5,Anxiety,3,2,4,6,3,5,5,5,I have not been tested but have had cv for last 10 days and been very unwell. I am worried that my lung function will never go back to normal but I guess also relieved that I seem to be getting better now. I think most of my family had milder symptoms than I did. The fevers were Terrible. I am hoping we can begin to release some of the measures in a few weeks but know that will depend on impact. A lot of negative a have happened but have dealt with those so far. Now I am worried to some extent about how we get back to more normal living and keep infection under control. Also I don’t want to get reinfected so hope that immunity is actually a thing which applies for a period of time.,3,Sadness,2,1,3,2,2,4,5,2,I am fed up being in lockdown. I want to go on holiday this year abroad. I know that we have to be in lockdown to keep infection levels low and stop people dying and wait for vaccine to be rolled out. I’ve had covid 19 last year and I have had first vaccine. My daughter who I was worried about didn’t get covid and has now had her vaccine. At same time I’m used to working from home and the simple life and not sure how much I will get back to rushing around everywhere. Hopefully all will progress although I guess there is the unknown of new strains so that will probably disrupt things. I live in Scotland so on the one hand it has been handled much better and on the other we live with a stricter regime and it makes me frustrated and angry at times.
630,6,Relaxation,4,2,4,6,3,8,8,3,"I am slightly nervous about it, more about the uncertainty than anything else. I want to know when lockdown will be over, and I want to know that the government really are doing all they can to increase medical resources.
Are we really just in isolation because there aren't enough medical supplies for us to be helped if we have corona?
I think the media are potraying too much information about it and we are not focusing on anything else in the news which is equally imporotant.
It's having a good effect on the environment.",6,Disgust,6,8,4,6,9,1,4,3,"I am disgusted at the government for the way they have handled it. We are only now making people do hotel quarantine, and they are not vaccinating people fast enough. They waste vaccines every day if people don't turn up instead of just offering them out with some kind of appropriate system. They should be giving money to everyone in the country irregardless of if they work or not - there should be a set sum to help people with bills. We are sat at home all day every day, and bills have increased exponentially."

I'm relaxed as there is very little traffic which means there is a general air of calm and we're seeing more of nature coming to the fore.  If I'm honest, I'll be sorry when somethings go back to 'normal'.  The only time I feel anything other than calm is reading certain posts on social media but I can walk away from that and go back to my 'bubble'.  I feel that the situation may be tightened up due to people not taking things seriously, or even that it may be prolonged.  As it is at the moment, this isn't causing us major problems.  It's probably the only time I haven't worried about us both being unemployed",5,Anger,7,5,3,4,1,4,6,1,"I’m angry at the people who are making light of the situation and putting others at risk through their selfishness. They seem to think they know better than the experts and their refusal to listen to reason is both frustrating and infuriating

The situation hasn’t affected me personally on a day to day level as I don’t socialise much anyway but I do worry that through de oak of what’s happening, people will cause the situation to last longer than it needs to 

I miss the peace and calm of the first lockdown "
632,5,Anger,6,3,5,6,2,3,4,5,"the first week I struggled adjusting to 'the new normal' and was very bored and irritable but now I feel I have adjusted well and feel normal most days, still bored a lot though. I do find the days go quick and im not as worried as I thought id be about the whole Corona situation. I'm slightly worried about my wage being different every month for the foreseeable future though. I just hope this virus goes as quickly if not quicker than it took to arrive in the first place.

There is an eerie feeling when you go out for your daily allowed exercise; i.e. there are very few cars and people about and everywhere is closed makes every day feel like a Christmas Day sort of feel, or that funny week inbetween Christmas and New Year where you're not certain of what day it is. ",3,Desire,5,5,5,6,6,4,4,6,"I feel like this has gone on way too long, initially we were told it would be 3-6 weeks lockdown, but realistically knowing it would be around 2 months lockdown. It's now just shy of a year on and if you don't take into consideration the vaccine, we're no better off than we were this time last year. Thank god for the vaccine! I feel lockdowns are a total waste of time and just delay the inevitable. I do feel because of the vaccine that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel but my main worries are my about my job."

I have started to use a meditation app in order to control my anxiety and enable me to sleep at night.  I started to use this tool after suffering a few nights of broken sleep.  On occasion I feel overwhelmed by the risk of catching the virus and have taken to watching less television news to control the overload of information.  I miss seeing my son who lives in his own house and also my dad who lives in a local care home as he has dementia. Bathe home has a “no visitor” policy in place.  I worry about him getting the virus and dying alone.",7,Sadness,2,1,5,4,6,5,2,2,"I had my first dose of the vaccine this week so I feel optimistic about the future.  I’m looking forward for the first time instead of being in some sort of suspended animation.  I can start planning for future outings, shopping trips and even holidays but with the understanding that some precautions are still needed, like masks and social distancing.  It looks like the vaccines combined with the lockdown are reducing the number of cases.  I am feeling more positive than I have at any time in the last year."

It is difficult seeing the number of deaths on a daily basis, reeled out on the news like it is the norm. It is a particular concern for those of us who have elderly parents at high-risk categories. Yet, if there is anything at all positive that can be taken from this, it's that maybe it will give the planet time to recover a little from pollution, and allow people to just slow down and hit the reset button. We will get through this. The world will continue to turn.",5,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,4,7,2,"I am a little concerned we are coming out of lockdown too fast. While the goals may have been set at 5-week stages, I cannot understand why some restrictions are being lifted while a good number of people, (namely the age group which is likely to be the most complacent and the spreaders) have not yet been vaccinated. 

And while the vaccine project is going well, I don't feel enough effort is being made by the government to remind those who have had the vaccine to remain cautious. At least until the entire population has been vaccinated at least once!"

I am having more time to do things like yoga and meditation and am spending less money as I'm not out socialising and using petrol etc. I miss my friends and miss socialising however but I have got around that somewhat by utilising online meeting platforms like zoom.

I have self-isolated for 3 weeks now and will continue to do so for as long as necessary to help overcome this pandemic! Nonetheless, it is still a rather scary time as it has been proven to impact anyone. The virus does not care who you are (nor can it) and it will take anyone's life. The unpredictability of the virus is one of the scariest things, as we do not know when the peak will arrive nor do we know if we can overcome this and restore the country back to its original sense of normality.",7,Anxiety,7,6,9,9,9,2,1,1,"I feel really anxious still as I just want to see my family.

I am not too anxious, but would be devastated if people close to me become affected. I was struggling last week and felt quite depressed, but this week I am feeling more uplifted and excited about things and have planned things to do. I am worried how long it will go on for and how I will cope and the severity it might get too. Today I feel more upbeat.",3,Sadness,6,6,6,6,8,5,7,6,"I don’t feel that worried about the coronavirus situation at the moment especially because of the vaccine. A lot of my family have had the vaccine as they are older age or doctors and I am getting my vaccine tomorrow as I have severe asthma. I am mainly sad now about the lockdown and am of the frame of mind that the effect of lockdown can be worse than that of the virus, though I do realise the severity of the virus and realise that lockdown must be put in place. I have been surprisingly quite relaxed about the virus on the whole though I am not sure why as I am usually quite susceptible to illnesses and thought that if I do have COVID I would get it badly."

I feel stressed, worried, lonely and isolated. I also feel utter disgust at those flouting lockdown and purring lives at risk, as well as compromising the NHS and the work they do to keep us safe

I a concerned about the government not doing enough to force social distancing measures and that by not acting, or whether they have indeed already left it too late, that our death figures will continue to rise. I am thankful that the UK government has put financial measures in place to support people and jobs, however.

I'm moderately concerned and certainly less anxious than I was, having had a first dose, but the overall feeling is that this won't ever end. I am struggling with major health anxiety which, for the last 12 months was focused on catching and dying from covid, however now I've had a first dose the feeling of concern around that is slightly less but instead has been replaced with other concerns. A painful toe? Must be diabetes. Back ache? Must be a reaction to the vaccine. IBS, must be concern. And so on, I can often only think of catastrophising any minor niggle. Of course, these are minor things but the impact of the pandemic on my mental health is absolutely massive "

I'm sad that people aren't able to go out as much as they normally can, particularly with the warm(ish) weather, and it being the start of the Easter holidays. It's particularly tough now because we're coming - at least it seems - towards the peak, in 7 to 10 days I think. On another note, I am feeling extremely lucky that I haven't been affected by it so far. I'm sad for everyone who suffers because of this. ",6,Desire,8,3,7,7,7,3,2,8,"I feel like this third lockdown has been the toughest. Four weeks for the second was quite hard to get my head around, especially at the beginning. But now that we've come so far through the third, and things are starting to look more positive, I'm being kept going by the hope that in a few weeks I'll be able to start doing the things I've been missing so much. So I'm very excited about that--but it's of course mixed with some sadness over the whole experience for everyone, the trials we've all had to face, some of course more than others. Also, can I really believe that everything will be open and back to normal by 21st June? Maybe it will, but I can't of course be too sure. So in short my feelings are mixed, although slightly leaning towards the more positive side of things. "

I am living alone and feel isolated but grateful for good relationships with my family, boyfriend and friends which are keeping me going.

Boris Johnson had to be admitted to hospital so who else knows what might happen to the political parties if someone dies. I think it's going to be a case where people will have to accept Covid-19 as another regular disease people get much like the common cold/flu.

I think that people are getting fed up with the lockdown and there will be increasing civil disorder if the situation doesn’t seem to be improving. On the other hand, I’m truly horrified by the authoritarian streak that has been revealed in many people, and am disgusted at the way that rather than promoting community understanding some individuals are calling for people to be shot in the street for going for a walk.

In terms of my own risk of infection, and any subsequent complications, I am fairly secure in my ability to fight it off, even if I'm unlucky enough to contract it.

I have also not had to see how this can affect hospitals etc. I can see why some people feel as if it's exaggerrated, but then I epxect they wouldn't think that if it was affecting them as it has others."

I am worried about how coronavirus will impact all areas of my own life (social, economic, career, family) alongside society in general and the economy. I don’t see an end in sight which worries me even more. I am concerned that the government is hiding aspects of the epidemic from the public. I am concerned that China has been untruthful with the world and that their death toll is much higher. I am worried that there may be a second wave of the virus which will destroy all of our progress ",6,Anxiety,5,5,8,8,5,3,2,2,"I still feel anxious as I don’t believe the end is in sight yet. I am reluctant to place too much belief in the vaccines helping us return to normal. There is a lot of different information out there regarding them and it’s difficult to know what to believe. I worry about the new variants and the problems they could cause. I am also worried about the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. Overall I feel too cautious to feel happy or look forward to the future, especially as even if the pandemic is almost over there are the economic and social consequences to deal with. Finally, I feel disappointed in the way that the U.K. government have handled this whole situation "

I see people who have taken it upon them selves to go to friends houses, go to the park and up my rural road for walks, not following the doll I’ll distancing guidelines. It’s extremely frustrating as someone who suffers with anxiety and depression because I feel like I do not have control, not over people as they can make their own choices but over my mental health as I’m forced to stay in where I won’t see my friends etc and it’s difficult. However, this can also be a blessing in disguise to me. I study French language and have been able to focus more on my studies now that I’m stuck at home. I feel on top of things for once and feel like I can catch up and keep up on all of my work as I’m doing it in my own time while also to deadlines. It’s a very contradictory time for my emotional and mental state but for everything else it is frustrating as I love being outside. However, it is selfish of others to go out when realistically that’s what’s making COVID-19 and it’s spread worse. The quicker we all stay inside and self isolate, the quicker this will all be over and we can be vaccinated etc. ",3,Anger,6,4,3,5,4,6,6,6,"I am prepared to live with corona as long as we all get our vaccines. The government has handled this terribly and the blame on young people at university especially is disgusting.

I also feel sad as I can't see my boyfriend at all. The only time I see him is if he comes shopping at my store! And yet we've been together 12 years. I know it's for the best but it's a sad time.

I can work from home but the whole company needs some time to get used to this new situation. Hearing about how others are trying to cope and talking about it makes things easier.

I have mixed feelings about the global situation. Eventually, we will get through this, but it seems like some governments are only concerned about bailing out companies from this and leaving individuals in a dire situation.

I am also very angry that some people are just ignoring the social distancing and not following the rules that the government have laid out.

Scotland is trying to resolve this matter using devolved powers as much as possible but the Westminster government should do more, or nothing at all and leave devolved administration free rein and funding. Either they give the money or give instructions, can't do neither of them.

In addition, if you are meant to catch the virus, then you probably will.

I think lockdown 3 has been the hardest on me but also on a lot of other people too. It's been a difficult start to 2021 but I'm feeling more confident in the roadmap out of this third lockdown and with the vaccine too that we will soon be out of this mess and getting back to some sort of normal. I'm missing seeing friends and family and going out for dinners and a year on it's even tougher on people as it's been such an unsocial year.

I live alone so I feel extrememly isolated and cut off from the world. I have been very lethargic and havent been doing much and the days are running into each other. I have also not been sleeping very well. My sleep patterns are all over the place and are usually resulting in me staying up until 5 or 6am and waking up late in the day.

The economy is a worry and I dare not even look at my pension pot for fear how much it has diminished.

I am lucky my job is secure and safe which eases the worry and anxiety a little bit but not much. I am also worried about my parents who are both high risk. We are all following government guidelines but it doesn’t make the worry any less. We are lucky we are young and healthy and so are taking advice to go out to buy basic essentials rather than taking online slots who are for the most vulnerable but it’s still an anxious time given that young and healthy people are dying from coronavirus.,3,Relaxation,1,1,4,4,1,8,9,5,I am feeling confident about the coronavirus situation at the moment.

I  think like many people we have found lockdown extremely difficult and we are very ready for lockdown to be fully lifted and for life to go back to normal. we are desperate to get out of the house and go on holiday because being in one place for so long really takes its toll on people.

It’s not really social distancing and helping stop the virus if people are still going out to do their daily shopping or meeting in parks! 
I’m anxious, very anxious that everything is out of my hands and I cannot do anything to help. I don’t have medical skills to help with the NHS and even if I did, would I put myself and my family at risk because the government are not ready to provide the right PPE.

It’s good to see that the death rate is progressing more slowly than what was initially predicted but it’s still worrying how many people are losing their lives, especially those working on the frontline in key services. I don’t really have much else to say on this subject and feel a minimum five hundred character limit on a response is somewhat excessive.

Other countries have managed to get back to normal far more quickly. The borders should have been closed as soon as the first case was identified with lockdown soon after.

I'm trying my best but at this point I may starve to death, which shouldn't make me happy but happy but there is something sobering about the whole situation.

The whole situation has been handled poorly and fishy snacks have shown that he will only help certain self employed people and the rest can suffer.

Fine. More? We're lucky to have a garden, so staying in our own space is a lot easier than it could be. We also share an allotment with another 2 families so we have *another* space we're allowed to go to. We keep chickens on it, so we have to go twice daily. I go in the morning (husband goes in the evening), and I think this routine is keeping me feeling more grounded than I might otherwise be.

I think numbers are going to climb - the lateral flow tests feel like making our kids do something unpleasant to themselves twice a week for not that much diagnostic help. Primary kids are unmasked and classes are packed and not particularly ventilated. At least the local university isn't going fully back before Easter, so perhaps our local numbers won't spike - but TBH I keep a close eye on daily covid data, I'm not sure if that's good or bad for my mental health, but I like to draw graphs. Our local numbers aren't falling for the last 3 weeks while we've been 'in lockdown' and we now know kids can catch and transmit covid, often symptom free themselves... so schools going in fully feels dodgy. In January - with numbers really high, and schools looking like they were going in I had resigned myself to catching it and hoping I got lucky (3 of my friends have had it badly, but nobody I'm close to has died). Now, with my age group maybe getting the vaccine before the summer it's going to annoy me if I get it now.

I'm convinced this government makes consistently bad decisions and makes things worse. The people who are being convinced that we have a clear timeline to 'back to normal' make me feel a bit sad, a bit angry at the state of the PM, all that.  "

Too cavalier about rule breaking and doing nonsensical self gratifying gestures like clapping.

The government appear to finally have an idea of what to do with vaccines but this seemed for quite a while like they didn't have a sound plan.

I also think we should be able to have one bubble to mix with as I'm very very lonely. My mum is my childcare bubble so I can see her everyday but not go in her house. It just doesn't make sense.

Also, there are many other key workers/sectors who are not NHS. Who are also doing a tremendous job to keep humanity safe, hygienic, streets clean, vulnerable people of young and old on drugs and alcohol, ill mental capacity safe as possible with a sound mind with their health precautions in place, government legislation in check the list goes on.

Well, one more thing maybe - I am tired of online shopping. I wish we could go inside the store and try things as normal. I have lost weight so have no clue what my size is anymore.

Furthermore, i feel that people need to start taking the coronavirus situation much more seriously, rather than treating it as a joke, i see people when am out laughing and making jokes whilst wearing their face masks, thisangers me greatly, not because i don't support the use of face masks but because it is a serious situation and they should just wear the masks rather than joking around with them.",2,Anxiety,2,3,2,7,3,6,6,1,"I feel that the situation is improving, but so did I after the other lockdowns, I’m just not sure what is going to happen next, I just want life to return to normal so that I can be with my friends and have fun.

Also I am uncertain about the new strains of coronavirus and that they may cause us to go into another lockdown, I am also unsure about the effectiveness of the vaccines a gain at these new strains, especially with some of them being able to evade the bodies immune system. 

I also have concerns about going on holiday,as I want to relieve a lot of stress, but unfortunately I am unsure whether we will be able to travel any time soon, I just want to leave my house to be brutally honest.  "

Vaccines will help but are not the only answer.
The country needs the truth of what happened with the virus and why it happened.  Hospitals haven’t done enough,  you can’t just stop treating other life threatening illnesses because of another life threatening illness, this has highlighted the way the nhs is badly run.

It's extremely frustrating to see people wandering about every single day doing non-essential things (I work in a pet store so see this every day I go to work). The attitude of our government is reflected in the people. This won't go away if we bury our heads in the sand and pretend it's a holiday; people are dying, other people are suffering. It's not going to just wear itself out. This will only go away when EVERYBODY makes a commitment to isolating themselves.",8,Anger,9,9,7,7,8,4,4,2,"Our government has done very badly at handling this, they have lied and swindled the people. They could have done so much better by caring about the people and not their pockets, by acting sooner, like other countries have done (e.g. China, New Zealand). It is extremely frustrating to see people who clearly and genuinely don't care, to be """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""leading"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" this country, lying the whole time, openly and brazenly to our faces. The track and trace fiasco is a national disgrace, as is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""pay rise"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for NHS staff. They deserve so much better.

In fact thats the least scary part, although we are not 100% sure there are alot of facts that science can present to us about the virus, e.g; how it spread, symptoms, how people recover and feel afterwards. 

The main source of worry and anxiety and also anger is the government who are not doing enough in order to flatten the curve and keep as many people alive - e.g; under funding in nhs, not enough ppe. As well as that it is also the groups of people who either think that this is not an issue so still carry on with their normal lives going to work and meeting friends or believe it is some sort of conspiracy and so they also chose to ignore the governments advice. ",6,Sadness,3,1,3,4,6,4,3,4,"I think the word tired best describes it. I am tired of lockdown, tired of working at home, tired of being alone. I am a bit more hopeful though, given the vaccination programme and the current rate of slow opening and easing of lockdown. The fact it is much slower has in a way made me feel more hopeful and have more faith in the governments actions compared to last year. I get very frustrated easily and i think it is because almost everything feels out of your control at the minute.

Anger at how the pandemic began. Anger at the people who are determined to carry on living as normal when the majority of us are sticking to the rules.

I'm angry that my son has missed nearly half a year of school. That it took 2 months for y daughter to get into a routine for nursery and not scream every morning but we will have to start from square one.

I miss my work and my colleagues, I miss my friends and my parents and siblings. I'm upset that we have had to cancel our holiday.

I'm worried as my husband has to continue to work and risk bringing the virus home everyday for a low wage. I'm also worried that the lack of routine will have a negative impact on my mental health.

Friends, family and strangers are turning on each other over things that shouldn't make a difference, if someone isn't wearing a mask, just accept it's because they have a reason.

I am worried about contracting it because I develop chest infections once or twice a year. Nobody is taking it as seriously as I am.

The only thing currently going to plan is vaccinations. I feel somewhat less anxious knowing that a vaccine is being given out, however I am still highly concerned about catching Covid.

I am also angry at international response to China, who I feel should be held to account for their practices and response which allowed the spread of Covid to be so swift at the outset. I don’t know exactly what I’m hoping for here, but possibly some international boycott of Chinese products and companies, unlikely through that is when their tendrils are creeping ever more steadily into African economies, and their commandeering of the South China seas continues unchecked.

I am worried about the new strains of the virus, and our ability to manage them. I am particularly concerned about what long term effects may gradually become apparent, both from Covid and from any vaccines (not that this will stop me having one when I get the invitation!). More a sense of resignation about these most of the time, but trepidation and anxiety if I let myself think too much about the myriad possibilities. Stoicism is still helping, though.

Some occasional feelings of optimism, probably more due to the signs of spring and my approaching sabbatical more than positive developments re Covid though, I think. Maybe it’ll be ok - most pandemics seem to have burned out within 2-3 years, after all. But I certainly feel more insular, happier to stay at home, in the UK, and fed up with tales of those travelling around still. I feel pessimistic about the chances of people/countries changing their practices in the future, and angry at the wasted opportunities to get control over climate change/scale down human expansion across the globe. Traffic on the road outside my bedroom window, London’s south circular, is back to even higher volumes than pre-Covid, I think. People are idiots - in the very literal Classical Greek sense :("

I'm also disappointed by the daily government briefings, the lack of useful information they contain and how they have quickly descended into a political defensiveness. Mistakes have clearly been made, and will likely continue to be made. No one is expecting a perfect response in such difficult times, but it's saddening to realise that even in a crises such as this, politicians will still more willing to put self and party above country and personal integrity.

I was also a little surprised to learn how much of a role political ideology factors in a countries overall pandemic response, both good and bad, and how unlikely it is that any real long term lessons will be learned to address any failings.

I think the roadmap is unrealistic and find it hard to believe that we will be all done with everything by June 21st. We have been given false expectations plenty of times so far so why should this one be any different. "

I think it will all come back again as people are going out and mixing. I dont want to ever go to a pub or restaurant again as this will always be around and could come back at any time. The virus will change as it has been already, and I think this fear will be here forever now. I am worried about some people saying that covid doesn't exist, and its all made up by the government. They are going to get us all infected."
790,6,Sadness,3,2,5,6,7,4,5,2,"I feel sad as my brain can't quite comprehend the impact all the daily deaths are having on people's lives. I am fortunate so far that it has not impacted my immediate friends or family but it scares me that this could quickly change. I feel I want to know about all these poor people on one hand, but on the other I am quite happy to continue in my little bubble. While at home each day able to do things that I've needed to do for a long time I am not feeling the full impact, despite the daily life restrictions.",5,Sadness,4,4,5,5,6,1,3,2,I feel things are improving and the end is in sight but there has been unnecessary loss due to bad management of the situation by the government. They acted too little too late initially and human lives were lost because of that. I personally have not lost anyone close but know it has had a huge impact on many around me. I am relieved that the vaccine has been distributed effectively and seems to be working well. Hopefully we will be able to continue living a Normal life soon. I am getting bored if Netflix and doing the same thing every evening.
791,9,Anxiety,7,6,9,9,6,2,4,1,I am anxious about getting the virus. I am saddened by all the death and suffering including our prime minister. I am thankful that so far my immediate family is healthy but worry when that might change. The future is so uncertain. I hope God protects us all. I am angry with those who are breaking the social distancing and putting the rest of us at risk. I feel sorry for those that are struggling financially as well due to this virus. It has worsened my mental health as well. I worry I may fall back into a deeper depression. Thankfully I am still able to receive counceling over the phone. I think that too many people are NOT taking this seriously and thus put more people at risk due to their actions.,9,Anxiety,6,8,9,9,4,6,3,6,I feel a bit hopeful as I will be getting my first vaccination shot this week. I also feel frustrated that things have not opened up yet in my area here in Aberdeenshire where the numbers are very low. I also am fed up with such emphasis on the schools whilst the rest of society is suffering. I am hopeful that this time next year we will be back to a bit more normal life. I am angry at those who had flouted the rules and continue to do so as it has meant longer in lockdown for all of us. The thought of getting back out there once things open is also a bit more daunting. Will I be safe? will there be another lockdown? How will I adjust after staying home for so long. I am very sad that corona virus has stopped me seeing my family for over a year now. I miss them.
792,8,Anxiety,6,4,8,8,8,5,5,5,"I am quite anxious about the situation currently as I cannot go and see my mother as she is in a high risk category so all I have been able to do is drop food at her door and wave through the window. I am a key worker and whilst I am working reduced hours, I am still having to work and are therefore more at risk than if I could just stay home. It is annoying when people don’t seem to be paying attention to how they need to stay at home or when greedy business owners decide that there ‘non essential’ business is key. ",8,Anxiety,7,2,7,9,5,5,4,3,"I’m feeling worried because I’m not sure how I feel about going back to school on Monday and I haven’t had a vaccine yet. I want to be able to give my mum a hug and can’t yet because it’s not safe. I don’t want to catch covid and I don’t want my family to be infected with it either. I want the world to go back to normal and to be able to go into a shop without risk. I want to be able to visit family and friends and to get my hair cut and my nails done. 
I think my daughter has missed out on a lot by not being able to go to play centres and ballet classes etc. I hope the projected route out of lockdown is able to go smoothly. "
793,5,Anxiety,2,2,4,5,2,2,4,3,"I am mildly concerned for myself but very concerned for a number of friends and relatives who have underlying conditions. I am also worried that the economy as a whole in my country and internationally will take a long time to recover and that vested interests will be trying to acquire as much of the emergency expenditure as possible. There are positives too in that air pollution from air travel and cars/vans etc. has fallen dramatically which does cheer me slightly. Overall though, these are worrying times with no obvious end point and poor government response the order of the day. ",5,Happiness,2,2,2,2,2,7,6,6,"I am hopeful things in the UK are improving but worried the Westminster Govt will open up activity too soon. Worldwide, too many people are travelling already and some countries are way behind in their vaccination programmes. Overall I am concerned that we are seeing a false dawn with another bad wave of deaths to come, especially with new variants. Some people still don't get it and are acting irresponsibly. This virus has not finished with us yet. It seems to be a very adaptable virus and will have a few more changes up its sleeve yet. I am cautious about starting to move about more freely yet."
794,9,Anxiety,3,3,7,7,6,4,4,3,"Anxious that I might catch it, anxious that someone I love might catch it. Anxious about how dangerous it can be and what the possible outcomes are as well as the worry over the practicalities of going to hospital when you can't be visited. Stressed by the social distancing measures and how people don't stay far enough away when you go out. Unsettled by the lack of firm plan for the future and the uncertainty for my employment and that of my partner.  Worried by the long weekend and how we can keep ourselves entertained if we're unable to go out of the house. ",7,Anxiety,6,4,8,8,7,4,4,2,"Depressed at the woeful response by the government and the number of people who have died. Frustrated by the wasted money on contracts for the mates of those in government on PPE. Worried about the chance of catching COVID still. Disappointed by the seeming inadequacy of the track and trace system. It feels like we still need to now more about how COVID is transmitted - who are the people who are still catching it in a lockdown, how does it still spread? 
The only surprise is the seeming success of the vaccination programme but I'm waiting for something to go wrong with that. "
795,6,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,1,9,9,5,"I cannot wait for this to finish and I hope people will respect the lockdown and stop going out like everything it's normal. I keep seeing everyday a lot of people out like they do not care. I have to go out everyday to work as I do work in NHS and I am disgusted by all these people. I think until they or someone close to them gets the virus they will not take it serious. Also I believe the fines for breaking the lockdown need to be way more drastic, starting from £1000 and if it happens the second time it should double.
",5,Anxiety,5,5,7,7,3,8,3,5,"I feel like we are about to get out of this situation as 20 milions of people in uk have been vaccinated. I just got the bloood test result yesterday saying that I have antibodies for the virus as result of the vaccine I had in January and most of my colleagues in healthcare are in the same siatuation which means that the vaccine is working and once we vacccinate more than 50% of the population we can slowly return to normal. However, the government is wasting/stealing billions of pounds on strange contracts with friends that don't come to fruition and then they offer a 1% 'payrise' for NHS staff, which actually is  paycut as the inflation is higher than 2% in the past year"
796,7,Relaxation,1,1,3,3,3,7,8,4,"I think the best words to describe how I feel are busy and overwhelmed.  I am busier then usual because I now have 5 homeschool children at home, whereas I am used to them being at school during the day.  I am feeling overwhelmed because suddenly far more people want to interact, video chat, call, text, e-mail, etc.  I am an introvert and I find the amount of social check-ins that are suddenly expected to be very overwhelming, time-comsuming and exhausting!  I feel like between 5 busy children at home and outside people constantly demanding my attention via video call, mobile phone, text, etc, that I am overwhelmed with expectations.  
I don't feel fear, worried or anxious because I don't have time to feel those things.  I don't have time to dwell on the situation we are in.",6,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,4,5,8,4,"I took a job as an essential worker 6 months ago.  When I took it I was a bit more anxious about catching or spreading the virus.  Six months later and that fear and anxiety has dwindled.   I think I have accepted the fact that I might get it, but I am doing everything I can to protect myself and my family.  I wash my hands constantly and expect my children to do the same, especially after coming in from outside.  We use hand sanitizer regularly.  I wear a protective gown, gloves and protective glasses at work, and dispose of my PPE carefully and properly.  I am not going to live in fear, but I am going to live with caution.  "
797,5,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,1,7,8,3,"I feel at this point that we've settled into our lives in this new routine. I'm not struggling with any of the measures put in place and it's been great for my partner to get to work from home. Although I of course hope the situation improves quickly from a public health perspective, I could personally maintain this life in lockdown for a few months quite happily assuming my personal situation doesn't change much. Some positives have been more time for exercise (using fitness videogames) and leisure activities, and discovering new ways to interact with friends and family while apart.",5,Relaxation,1,1,2,3,2,6,7,2,"We are very much settled in the way things are right now, and the weekly shop is pretty much the only thing that causes some COVID-19 anxiety. It wasn't long ago that the proposed roadmap for coming out of lockdown was announced, and I think the full lifting of restrictions is too soon. The date is also right before my birthday, so I'm hoping others won't try to pressure me to do something sociable, because I'm not comfortable with going back to normal until I've had both of my vaccine doses. It's still long enough away that I'm not giving it too much thought right now though as things could easily change."
798,8,Anxiety,4,6,9,9,7,2,2,1,I’m really worried me or my family will get ill. I’m worried who would take care of my kids if I am ill. I am worried about being taken to hospital all alone. Worried about how I can get grocery delivery slots. I feel like this is never going to end. I am just worried all the time about it. I feel like the virus is getting really bad in this country now. I am checking the daily figures when they get announced on the website every day. My family are also quite worried and I have elderly relatives which is a concern for us.,7,Relaxation,4,2,5,6,4,5,7,2,"I feel concerned about the new variants that keep appearing. I’m feeling grateful for the vaccine. I’m worried children are being sent back to school too early. I worry for my family members, especially those with existing conditions. I’m worried about my job and how things will be when the office opens again. I also feel worried that we will never get our old way of living back. I feel that our government have acted too slowly and that’s why things have been so bad here. I think the lockdowns have been too short and not enforced enough."
799,8,Anxiety,4,4,6,8,6,8,2,3,"Im worried i may have underlying issues that may come to light if get corona. 
I am concerned about my diet and lifestyle without being as active as normal.  
I am concerned about my mental health not seeing everyone. 
I am concerned about my husband and his vulnerability.  I have massive anxiety about shopping but not about stock piling but not being able to get what i need. I am struggling with my routine being out of sync. It is effecting my sleep and wearing me down which in turn i worry will go against me when i get the virus. ",8,Anxiety,6,1,7,9,5,2,1,1,Im on constant edge about corona. Ever changing sityation is taking its toll on my mental well being. Now Monday with schools reopening my fear is it is too soon. What if this triggers another lockdown can people cope with another lockdown. U fear that too many jobs are lost and we will be payingbthe debt back for my lifetime.  I'm scared my family will get the virus becayse they are wanting to get normality bak. Will they rush qnd fall foul to not following safety precaution. My head is full of worry  i want to seey friends qnd family but i want to be safe and i don't know how that can be.
800,6,Anxiety,6,6,5,7,6,6,4,4,"Uncertain about how long the Lockdown will last, would like to know more about time so I can prepare. The length of uncertainty isn't helping work as the moment I'm planning as if things get back to normal in few weeks but might not be and it's frustrating to make plans that might not happen and it be wasted effort. I'm on annual leave this week which is a good break but giving me more time to think. This morning was particularly hard as I felt quite stressed but had a bath. I'm frustrated about the suggestions to stop exercise as going for walks / runs are important for my mental and physical well-being and I'll miss them if I can't",6,Sadness,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,3,"Frustrating, the government's don't seem keen to fix the problems and there's a real risk things will get worse and we'll miss the vaccine opportunity. The problem is communications and messaging. Too much focus on rushing out of lockdown not limiting the impact of the virus. I try to not pay attention to the news as it's frustrating. Mainly feel sad all the time. Not having kids means that my life is quite different.

However, it's the weekend and I can chill out watching a film on Netflix.

500 characters seems quite long when it says a few sentences"
801,8,Anxiety,7,6,8,9,7,3,6,4,"i am very sad and worry about whats going on in the country, unable to leave the house and starting to feel depressed being trapped in and away from friends and family. Worried things will not go back to normal for at least half a year.
I worry that this could lead to depression for a lot of people if we can't go back to normal. Restaurants and bars have been closed for long time, lot of business will be forced to close down and people will lose their jobs.
I worry that my parents will get corona virus as they are at that age of over 70. Some of my friends have bene forced to take furlough from work. ",7,Relaxation,8,6,6,6,7,4,5,6,"I am very nervous that it is still going on, I miss going out and seeing my friends and going to restaurants.
I want lockdown to be over, I really need a holiday and a break from work. Work has been so hectic at the moment can't even leave the house. 
The vaccine needs to work so we can go back to our normal life's, been nearly one year since we went into lockdown.
Since we went into lockdown last year I have been working from home on a daily basis and not hair a hair cut in 4 months now.
Government is going too slow on opening shops and restaurants"
802,8,Anxiety,6,6,8,9,8,1,4,1,"The whole situation makes me very anxious. I do not believe, as a country, we are doing everything to prevent the spread. I believe we should be in a full and proper lockdown like other countries. I fear for my children and their futures. My son is 4 and just about understands school is closed and we aren't allowed out and we cant see family and friends. My husband has been furloughed and that worries me as we're not in control of things. I hate going to the supermarket because there's always a minority of people who wont or dont socially distance themselves.",1,Anxiety,1,4,1,9,8,7,3,6,"I am very anxious as the schools have literally just re opened and my son is back to school, i am anxious for him about how much time he has missed and how much he has missed his routine and his friends. I am sad because I miss everyone so close to me, i havent seen grandparents for months and my youngest child hasn't seen family in nearly a year and that is half her life wasted and gone from meeting everyone. 
I am annoyed and disgusted with the government for taking so long at trying to handle this situation, I am annoyed they are forgetting close friends of mine because they are newly self employed. I am annoyed at managers and business owners whop think the rules do not apply to them. My husband is NOT a key o9r essential worker, so why has he been working this entire time INSIDE peoples houses?! And not having the opportunity to be tested weekly etc."
803,8,Anxiety,8,7,8,8,8,1,2,8,"Primarily, I am extremely anxious about the whole situation. I am worried about the health of my family and friends, myself and the world in general. I am worried about the economy and everyone’s livelihoods. And I am worried about my future plans, which this whole situation is threatening to affect quite profoundly. 
I am also very angry. I’m angry at how people making poor decisions and breaking the law led to this outbreak starting in the first place. And I’m angry at how unprepared governments around the world have been for this sort of situation. ",8,Sadness,9,7,6,9,9,1,1,7,"Overall, I feel depressed about everything. The corona situation has robbed me of my dream job in America, and is making everyday life a misery. I currently work in a supermarket, and the company doesn’t seem to care about keeping us safe, and a lot of our customers don’t follow social distancing or mask wearing rules. The government has let all of us down with their dreadful mismanagement of the pandemic and I will never forgive them. I do, however, feel optimistic about the future. We have the vaccines and cases are falling, so it seems things might finally get better. "
804,7,Anxiety,6,4,7,7,6,3,3,2,"I feel anxious about the current situation because of the uncertainty and how much it has affected our daily lives so far, and we do not know how long it is going to go on for. It is worrying hearing about the current infection rate and the increase in deaths per day. I am also angry at all the people that are completely ignoring the requirements for us to socially distance ourselves from relatives and friends. 
I feel worried about the lack of robust information about Covid-19, for example the lack of information on how to 'treat' the virus and fear that way more people are actually infected than the official figures show.
",6,Anxiety,6,6,7,9,7,3,2,1,"The Covid situation at the moment is very worrying with schools reopening. I am fearful that the Covid situation will get worse again before it gets better. I feel sad at the amount of pain this has caused people, including the people close to me. I am angry at how much COVID is having an impact upon my education and my health, it is affecting my day to day living and I am also nervous that restrictions will be lifted in the next few months. In addition, I am incredibly angry at those who are ignoring the Covid lockdown rules."
805,7,Anxiety,6,1,5,8,5,1,1,1,"I feel anxious, restless and worried about my relatives. Annoyed at the world's governments for not acting sooner, and concerned for the effect it will have on my child. I enjoy staying at home, but feel frustrated at not easily obtaining groceries and that I can't spend time with my grandparents. I'm generally an optimist but feel that this problem will affect us for quite a long time, and long-term am extremely concerned that vulnerable relatives will contract the virus and die. I also feel despairing of people who are not taking the threat seriously.",6,Sadness,4,1,2,6,7,6,2,1,"I’m glad that my parents and grandparents have had vaccines, which feels hopeful for the future. But i’m sad that my child can’t have the social experiences that I think she should at this age. I’m frustrated that we are stuck at home and it’s too cold to go walking or play outside. 

The weather is compounding my mood - if it was sunny and warm I wouldn’t mind so much. But the months of freezing weather have made me so miserable.

Overall I have benefited from the virus, I got a job in an industry that’s profiting and can work from home, but recently it’s been hard to see the up side because it’s been so long. Even small things that would make me happy at the moment, like nipping to ikea for a new piece of furniture is impossible. I feel totally stuck and fed up, and overworked. "
806,6,Anxiety,6,5,7,9,6,3,1,1,"I feel anxious and fed up of it. I feel drained by the constant news about it. I'm worried about my elderly parents and how it would affect them if they contracted the virus. I don't think they would survive. I am in a constant state of anxiety and can't relax. I only go out once a week, to take groceries to my mother. The constant and conflicting news stories are relentless and I find myself doomsurfing on the internet and social media most days, including late at night, which is preventing me sleeping",9,Anxiety,8,6,8,8,5,3,2,2,"I am feeling very anxious about the corona situation. I am feeling very angry and frustrated at people's selfish behaviour and anxiety about the future. As I am vulnerable and cannot be vaccinated at the moment, I'm really scared about the future as I think people will stop caring at all about social distancing and face coverings as soon as they are vaccinated, not considering those of use who are vulnerable but cannot be vaccinated. It is a very scary time and I don't know what the future holds apart from more shielding and isolation and anxiety."
807,6,Anxiety,1,1,3,5,3,4,3,3,"I'm satisfied that I'm doing all I can to avoid contracting or spreading the disease, so I try not to scare myself with worst-case scenarios. I'm surprised to feel supportive of the UK government's response to the epidemic and some admiration for the prime minister - to whose other policies I am strongly opposed. I am trying to use my time in lockdown to good effect but finding it harder than usual to concentrate. I have one daughter living in Madrid who is okay, but obviously I am worried about her. I have another daughter in the UK who is recovering from a mild case of Covid-19, so feel relieved about her recovery.",4,Happiness,2,1,3,4,4,7,3,6,"Very optimistic about humanity's ability to overcome Covid-19 with vaccines. Cautiously planning some return to international travel and normal society. I feel a kind of justified cynicism with regard to the actions of the UK government, which has made a mess of almost everything before succeeding with its vaccination programme (which is really the NHS's programme). I feel very sorry for young people, especially those whose careers have been blighted, often before they've got started. I'm using the lockdown to learn new skills - piano and German - but finding it hard to focus. "
808,9,Sadness,3,4,8,8,9,2,2,4,"I feel very sad and frustrated. My father was diagnosed with motor neurone disease just before coronavirus took hold. I am so sad to be missing out on precious memories with him and hope once this is all over I will still have time.  We have had to cancel our family holiday to Italy and I worry I will never get that chance again.  
I’m worried for my husband who needs to return offshore next week and fear for his safety. 
Myself and my daughters have been self isolating for 5 weeks now as my eldest daughter is immunosuppressed.  My children miss their friends and schools. 
This is an extremely hard time for everyone but we all need to do as we have been asked and we will get through it. ",8,Anger,8,5,7,7,8,2,3,7,"I feel robbed of life for over a year - my children have suffered greatly and I worry about the experiences they have missed.  My terminally ill father has missed out greatly - from the lack of support available, services cut, unable to see friends, enjoying holidays and just generally everything that would have made his life a little easier at this difficult time. 

I feel we could have recovered from this a lot quicker as a country as we are an island and could have stopped travel right from the beginning that makes me angry."
809,8,Anxiety,8,8,7,7,7,4,3,1,"I feel incredibly sad that so many people are dying with this horrible virus. It seems to be a real genetic lottery at the moment and it all depends on your genes to see if you survive or not. 
I am also angry at the government for not investing in the NHS which they are now relying on heavily to pull everyone through. 
I also feel anxiety for the people currently suffering and for my family. If the age at which people die from the virus now no longer just limited to older generations, then it stresses me out that anyone close to me can die. ",6,Anxiety,3,4,5,7,5,5,5,5,"A bit fatigued by it all now and hoping it will all end soon. 
It is getting a bit tiresome now and I do wish things would get back to normal. However, I am worried whether we will ever truly get back to normal. I think the whole pandemic has meant people's priorities have changed significantly. I am still working from home but do feel that work has invaded home life. I have put better steps in place to look after my mental health. On the good side being there with my family and getting to school runs and not having to take the tube has been a god send. I don't miss the commute at all. "
810,7,Anxiety,8,6,6,9,6,2,2,2,"I am unsure of what future holds worried I won’t see family members again and do things I enjoyed doing prior to virus. It has made me think what have a take for granted prior to this and how much people and friends mean to me.
Also worries about future virus that may come as a result of this one this was not expected and in cure climber worries that once this one sorted out further virus could spork from this one.
Also one cleared and all restrictions lifted how I am going to be affected financially I need to work and can’t because of the curfew and the risk to pass the virus on.",8,Fear,6,4,7,8,5,3,6,4,"Corona is very scary although things are easing off still scared of potential relapse in virus causing future lockdowns and causing depression.
Life has been totally turned around and frozen due to everything going on and I do not see an end to this way of life we are all going to have to rethink how we go about day to day business and be mindful of who we come into contact with especially family members who are vulnerable to prevent them being put at risk.
Although vaccines are about it is nerving to know that other variants could be perking about and potential re infect family members."

I am scared and worried constantly for my families financial future. Everything is so up in the air at the moment. Everything is a worry . I wonder what the future will be like when all of this is over. Will it be the same. How different will things be. I worry for the safety of my husbands job he cannot ve furlough as he started a new job.on 9th march. He has been constantly employed for 25 Years.

Ready for my children to resume normal school life they have missed out on so much and I'm worried about how behind they actually are with their school work and whether this will have any future detrimental effects on thier mental health in the future
812,7,Anger,7,6,7,6,5,6,4,3,I feel uncertain and not in control of things and am left wondering when ur will finally end but information is conflicting and the government have no stabilising influence at this time. It makes me feel angry at how it’s being handled. Anxious for the future and the impact it will have on my business. Sad that I can not see my mum who is in the extremely vulnerable catagory and isolating in cornwall miles away. I feel I have little control at times and find this situation frustrating and it leaves me feeling restless. I’m not sleeping as well and restless and finding it harder to relax than I used to.,4,Anger,8,7,3,3,6,2,4,1,I feel frustrated by the corona situation and the way that it has been handled by the government. The lockdown has been hard and I am tired of being told what to do by the government and don’t trust a lot of what they say. I feel we are being sent a lot of mixed signals and it’s confusing with little light at the end of the tunnel. I feel that the endless lockdowns are detrimental to my mental well being and I am angry by the way everything has been left too late and we are all paying the price now with longer lockdowns and a government that takes no responsibility for its mistakes.
813,7,Sadness,1,1,7,7,8,4,2,1,I am concerned for older members of my family as they could be seriously ill if they were to catch this. I’m also feeling sad about not being able to see family & friends and not being able to go out apart from my one walk a day. I feel positive that we will get through this but find I have good days and bad days. Now that the prime minister is very unwell with Coronavirus this has made me more anxious as it almost has made it more real. I’m thankful that I have my husband and two children living me so that I’m not alone each day. I am also thankful that my family have been unaffected by this virus so far. I also appreciate my freedoms and loved ones more than I did before this situation.,3,Happiness,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,2,At the moment I feel positive about the future. With the UK vaccination program going well and kids now going back to school I feel that we will get back to some sort of normality soon. There now seems to be some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and that restrictions will soon end. I’m looking forward to being able to see family and friends again and for the summer to be easier. I am a little concernes about the variants that seem to be emerging. Also nest winter is a concern with virus rates possible going up again.
814,7,Fear,1,1,9,8,5,1,2,1,I’m scared someone in my family home will get the virus and end up severely ill in hospital. I’m constantly worried that if any of us go into hospital they may die alone. This worries me more with my two children. I’m being eaten up with anxiety at the thought of them being scared and without their mum or dad to make them feel better. I’m paralysed with fear that there may not be life support equipment for any of us should we need it. I’m concerned that if any of us get the Corona virus it’s missed as being severe enough to go to hospital and we die at home in pain.

I do not feel confident in the governments dealing of this. Far too many mistakes by them. Big organisations, including supermarkets have a pandemic policy in place. It took far too long for this to be implemented.
I’m happy my children are back at school but not happy if they have to isolate for a period of time. My youngest really struggles with the constant changes and not knowing if he is in school or not. Bearing in mind that we haven’t been around germs for a long time my children will catch something which will mean more time out from school.

815,7,Fear,6,6,8,8,7,6,3,4,I feel anxious that myself or my family may get the virus and it will lead to us being ill or worse. I feel like a lot of the stories that are published in the media are scaremongering a lot of people which is heightening the levels of anxiety in people. I also feel angry towards the people who are not listening to the guidelines and are not staying at home as they are encouraging the virus to spread and are not taking the precautions. I also feel worried that I will contract the virus and pass it onto my family as I am a keyworker and I still have to go to work. I also feel,7,Anxiety,5,6,7,8,7,5,2,6,"I feel concerned that the Coronavirus will continue to rob many lives and affect our lives for the future. It makes me feel anxious as I wonder what the world will look like when it is safe to return to some normality again. It makes me nervous thinking about what ‘’normal’ might be and whether we will have a new normal that we have to just adapt to. Coronavirus has affected every person in some way and it has changed the world. It makes me feel anxious thinking about the amount of people who have lost their jobs, their homes and their families."

817,3,Relaxation,2,1,2,2,1,5,6,5,I feel the country would be better off if everyone stops being selfish and stays indoors. In addition to this police should patrol public spaces greater due to many still gathering at parks regardless of the laws enforced. Coronavirus is greatly affecting everyone especially those like me who live with a grandparent so have to be more careful when leaving the house in order to not bring it home due to old people being at a much higher risk of developing worse symptoms resulting in hospitalisation which puts a much greater strain upon the NHS.,3,Relaxation,1,2,2,3,2,9,9,6,"At the moment I feel less anxious about the pandemic due to the vaccine being rolled out and the number of deaths per day decreasing significantly. The advances in the vaccines and lateral flow tests have led me to feel less stressed and safer to go out for exercise and for essential journeys to do the weekly shop. In addition, the fact more individuals are choosing to wear masks fills me with a higher level of confidence and makes me feel much safer than before when many people were choosing not to wear them even if they did not suffer from any health issues preventing them from wearing any form of facial covering whether that be a mask and/or a shield.

I recognise that what is happening is significant and that I am in an extremely lucky position (able to work from home, not vulnerable, et cetera), and I do feel for those on the front lines or who lose loved ones.

I am trepidatious because people seem to want to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""go back to how it was"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but this was not without its problems and however trying the last year has been, there are positive lessons to learn about work, connectivity and community, and I hope these are taken forward.

I also feel powerless to help, as I do not have any relevant skills & thus I'm not useful right now. This is a silly feeling, as it doesn't help anyone; at the same time it's not actually strong enough to prompt me to do more than just a few donations and gift vouchers. 
I also feel rather sad about my friends, who are in a worse position. I feel entirely blessed with my partner - but again, I'm lucky & not everyone is.

I’m rather fortunate, relatively to many people, but this doesn’t stop me from feeling sad and tired, just makes me also feel guilty - which is also not helpful.

A lot of people seem to think they don’t need the jab or to listen to guidance and this is very concerning even with the decreasing death rate.

The risk of going outdoors even to shop for essentials is a concern, but necessary as it is difficult to find available slots with supermarkets.  some people are not taking it seriously and people with symptoms are even carrying on as usual. This is sadly putting the eternal public at risk.  Not knowing when things will begin to improve and get better, will it be weeks or months. This is completely the unknown and very frightening.

I have children aged I'm in quandary thinking about whether it's the right decision to send them I n or keep the off. I feel it's too early and our household will be exposed.

Why not just say if you already have masks and it makes you feel better when shopping crack on? Obviously with PPE being in short supply frontline workers are now a priority, but those of us who acquired masks before the whole thing kicked off shouldn't be made to feel almost as though it's bad to wear them?

Hundreds of thousands of people have died at the hands of the government, and I don't understand how the government came to make these decisions only to back track them weeks later because of repercussions.

There are still a few factors that may cause case nums to go back up again such as schools reopening etc but many people have had vaccines so maybe this will stop the cases rising again.

Overall I am looking forward to living a normal life again and seeing friends/family and going to bars. The government haven't done too well to combat covid as there are many unemployed people struggling to find work and our high street stores are dying but there is nothing we can do about it.

I feel like a portion of society are not taking the situation seriously enough.  The government should introduce stricter lockdown plus tougher punishment.

My life at the minute is mostly staying in the house where I watch tv browse online and listen to the radio or read books.

i am only anxious about what i should do after graduating, whether i will have a normal post-graduation experience (job-search, settling down in potentially new location, etc.). i am an international student which makes travelling necessary and it worries me that i cannot travel worry-free, and that quarantine is still a necessity. it seems like time is wasted for quarantining, even though i do know its necessary and i will still do it.

i am quite angry at institutions still for not being transparent in where our money is going to. now that everything is online, i understand that funds are allocated for technical support, but i believe we do not need to pay that much tuition still. my university is also one of those who still apply annual increments to tuition fees, so i wonder where those increments are going."

The most anxiety comes from spreading to other people who are not as healthy as I am, which is a horrible feeling. To see how many people have died from the virus has made me feel afraid for the families who have to watch loved ones die without being able to say goodbyes fully and have to see them die without being comforted in their transition.",6,Sadness,4,1,4,6,8,6,3,7,Now that the government have released a road map oout of lockdown this has made me feel slightly better about the situation as I know that hopefully things will be getting back to normal soon.

I'm also deathly worried for my parents, who aren't really in the most at-risk age group but are still 'older' and my father has a history of strokes. It kind of feels like an inevitability that we will contract it and feeling like someone (or possible multiple of people in my family) could die feels like a mind-numbing reality. I feel like I'm sitting around waiting to die all the time. 

In general the situation feels bleak. I feel like I have the most sympathy and concern for still-developing countries and refugees who are either displaced or people from war-torn countries. What hope do they have. The knock-on effects from this on a global scale will be so painful.

I am doing what I can to help, including volunteering, and trying to focus on work, though I feel frequently distracted, unable to focus, despairing, and though I can't concentrate a troubling amount of the time. I feel sorry for the country and world in the long-term as well as the current time. We need each other and connecting only online or by phone feels exhausting and draining too much of the time.

I have some anxiety about that, especially as someone with mental health conditions who has just managed to get a long-standing eating disorder under control through a pretty robust routine of meal times and order to my day. I am a bit concerned about going back to a tiring commute too. I am worried for the economy for the long-term and believe we will be paying for the virus for decades, and that those who have continued to work throughout will not necessarily benefit. "

I am deeply concerned about the economy and how it will recover. I cant see how they can lift any of the restrictions without a serious amount of people becoming infected. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest incidents that has happened in this country in the last 100 years. My main concern is I may lose someone close to me.

 There's hardly any jobs that are working full time only the essential ones we all need to get out and try and save the economy as quickly as possible or there isnt going to be n economy to save.

I feel confident that the end of lockdown is near, and there is a good chance they life will return to normal at some point during this year. I am looking forward to seeing people in-person and going to restaurants to eat and drink again, as this is the one thing I have missed the most during lockdown since it started.

but then I think, if they don't take it seriously, maybe i am over worrying? (i know this is not true)

Because it's all i've had. 

My partner and I live in a house that even though it's very full it feels empty and like there is nothing to do.

I saw talked to an old friend today and she told me that someone I know has been diagnosed with the virus so it has made it feel very real suddenly, and made me worry more for my mum and her health. I feel annoyed at people who are not following the social distancing guidelines and annoyed at the government for not doing enough. I also feel tired as all this worrying makes me sleepy! It has been a lovely day though so it has encouraged me to have a good walk which lifted my spirits. ",6,Anxiety,5,6,5,7,5,4,4,3,"I am starting to feel a bit more hopeful that we may be over the worst. I had my vaccine yesterday and my mum has had hers so I’m starting to look forward to making plans to see her, as it’s looking ever closer to being possible. There is still a lot of worry and sadness but the vaccines are rolling out fast so hopefully it won’t be for much longer. For the UK atleast... there is still a lot of work to do over the rest of the world which I fear will take a long time. 
It is frustrating to see people breaking the rules. I don’t understand why everyone can’t work together to get it over with faster and get the transmission rate down. "
889,8,Anxiety,4,3,9,9,9,1,1,1,"Worried about my own wellbeing and the wellbeing of my family and friends,
Worried that I cannot go seek medical attention for other issues as I face an increased danger of contracting the virus if I go to these places.
Can't leave the house as I'm severely asthmatic and genuinely feel as though I may die.
Haven't left the house since March 22nd, and I'm worried about how long I will be inside with limited sources for food and supplies.
Worried how my job and the economy will be affected after this.",7,Anxiety,9,9,9,9,8,2,1,2,"I think I feel a lot more hopeful this year with the vaccine, and I hope this can be eradicated so we can go back to living a normal life. I do still fear people are not taking it seriously and are putting everyone at risk by not following guidelines. I’m very angry about this as we could have been out of this a lot sooner as we are an island and there is absolutely no reason it should have gotten as bad as it has. I am thankful that my friends a d family are safe, and pray to God we all remain safe and make it through this. This has been an incredibly difficult time and I have severely suffered mentally and I do think more needs to be done with regards to help the physical and mental health of everyone coming out of this. I am very upset I couldn’t hug my cousins as we buried their mother, I’m very upset I haven’t been able to see my friends in over a year, and mostly I’m distressed as it doesn’t seem to end because the government are incapable of making timely decisions."
890,7,Anxiety,3,2,7,8,7,3,2,2,"Scared of losing family members. Scared of catching the virus and infecting other family members  Feeling alone as our family unit is isolated from the rest of our family. Anxious as there doesn't seem to be a way that we can get out of the current situation safely. Anxious about vaccination and medication becoming available in a timely manner. Scared for family members going outside, scared of going out myself. In need of dental treatment as I've broken a tooth that I can't get looked at. Fearful of losing my job even though I am currently on furlough",7,Anxiety,6,8,6,8,4,2,2,3,"I feel hopeful that the vaccination programme is doing enough to bring the pandemic to a manageable level but am afraid it won't eliminate it completely. People are still not acting in an appropriate way to completely remove Corona virus from our country. Even without my own household the rules are not being followed, even though I am explains to household members how vulnerable to the virus. I am disgusted at how the UK government has acted, spending a stupid amount on test and trace and then failing to reward or encourage NHS staff to carry in fighting"
891,6,Anger,8,7,4,4,6,5,5,4,"I'm fairly relaxed personally, as I'm fairly sure that my family and I have already had covid-19.  I am, however,  angry and disgusted with the government handling of the situation.  I believe that political dogma,  incompetence and ineptitude has lead to many unnecessary deaths.  The government has repeatedly dissembled and blatantly lied about its handling of the situation. If we cannot trust the government under these circumstances,  we are approaching a state of fascism.  Furthermore,  individual members of the government repeatedly flout their own rules designed to limit the spread of covid-19.   Our Prime Minister boasted of visiting a hospital where there were covid-19 patients and shaking hands with 'everybody'. This was an act of criminal irresponsibility. ",6,Anger,7,6,2,2,2,6,7,5,"The situation seems to be improving but the government handling of the situation is not inspiring confidence.  Lifting the lockdown seems to be a matter of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how soon can business start making money?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rather than """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""when is the safest time to lift lockdown? """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   We have seen two relaxations of restrictions followed by increasing infections and deaths.   On both occasions, decisions were driven by commercial considerations rather than scientific or medical considerations.   The government always claim to follow the science whilst actually giving priority to economic factors. "
892,3,Desire,4,1,4,4,5,5,5,9,"Honestly, the biggest thing I keep feeling is the desire to get back to normality. This situation has ruined my plans for the next year and it feels rather deflating. The time inside not having to work has been nice, but its just getting really repetitive and I honestly can't wait for it to be over! 

The time with friends in the house has been great. With finishing uni we've not seen each other properly for months, so that has been the shining light of this whole experience. We're just trying to make the most of what has been our final year, so I guess it isn't all bad. 

I'm very thankful that my family and friends are all well, so it's just a matter of waiting this out and getting life back on again!",3,Desire,5,3,2,4,3,4,4,8,"I'm honestly really rather bored of this all now. I really want to get on the back end of the whole situation and get back to normal life. I've gone through the spectrum of being sad and annoyed about it and am now at the point of looking forward for doing normal things again. 

With the rising number of people being vaccinated I'm feeling hopeful that we won't be dealing with this for too much longer. I'm far less concerned about the safety of my family now which is also a lot better for my mental health. My nan got covid around November time and the stress of it all was horrible. But now knowing she's safe and vaccinated I feel a whole lot better. My mum should be vaccinated soon too so I'm feeling really hopeful."
893,6,Sadness,5,4,5,6,6,4,4,3,"I mainly think it's sad how people have lost loved ones and our lives have completely changed. However, I am making the best out of this quarantine and using it as time to be productive. I am worried about catching the virus as I live with a loved one who is in a high risk group, however I am taking social distancing seriously so hopefully we will be fine. I am holding on and riding this out, and really hope that everyone else takes this isolation seriously too so that we can get this over with ASAP.",4,Anxiety,4,3,4,7,6,3,2,2,"I am feeling tired, fed up, lonely burnt out and anxious about the whole thing, especially as it's now been a year since the start of the pandemic - this means my second birthday in lockdown will be in a few weeks, and last year I definitely wasn't expecting two lockdown birthdays! However I am optimistic that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel and grateful that I and my loved ones are alive and healthy. I'm also a bit worried about whether the world has changed forever and that things will never be the same again. "
894,4,Relaxation,2,1,1,1,1,7,8,3,"I’m concerned about how the rate of deaths is increasing day by day, and it seems that we have not yet reached the peak. This feeling isn’t helped by the fact that I still have to go into work in a large office with many other people, therefore increasing my exposure risk. I’m frustrated by people ignoring the guidelines set out by the government as it’s just going to end up penalising us all. That said, the government could do more to combat this by enforcing stricter rules. I’m also feeling lonely. I would say that I can be quite introverted and do enjoy time to myself at home, and I don’t much like physical contact from friends or family. But this is often the way because it’s what I decide and being told that I can’t just pop round my friend’s for a cup of tea, or hug my parents is quite isolating.",2,Happiness,1,1,1,1,1,9,8,7,"I’m feeling the most positive about the situation since this all started a year ago. We have vaccines now which are being well rolled out and there is a roadmap to reopening shops etc and getting life back to a more normal state. Cases are dropping as are deaths which is reassuring and joyful to hear. There is finally light at the end of a very long tunnel and I’m excited to get my jab and be able to meet up with friends, family and colleagues and do things in real life again as opposed to virtually."
895,8,Anxiety,1,1,8,8,7,1,1,1,The whole Coronavirus situation is very scary. I think the government are doing a decent job at keeping us informed and could possibly have done more at the beginning but that slowly we may be getting there. However I am loath to go outside for fear of catching or passing on the disease and am wary of when it will all end. I am mentally prepared to have to work from home for at least 12 weeks but wonder whether that is too optimistic. I fear any of my family getting the disease and hope that a cure is found sooner rather than later.,6,Disgust,6,7,5,5,6,1,1,1,Disgusted with the UK government’s performance. They have caused untold misery with their incompetence and dithering. They have lied to the public and have made so many mistakes with their response. At times they really ought to have known better. It is particularly annoying how they have wasted untold billions on a failed track and trace system. They have also given contracts to their mates for PPE and yet most of the time the companies receiving this money hard never produced PPE before. It’s a national scandal
896,7,Sadness,2,1,6,7,8,5,3,1,I feel anxious constantly but it’s in the background. Today has felt better because I’m not at work so it’s not been at the forefront of my mind. If I think about it I can’t quite get my head around it all. I feel scared that it’s going to get or that someone I know could get it. Initially I wasn’t too worried but now people are dying and it scares me to think someone I know could actually die from this. It’s just so surreal and unbelievable. I work in a hospital so I hear about the realities of the situation. This doesn’t help my anxiety but at the same time I want more information,4,Relaxation,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,1,"I’m feeling a lot more hopeful now. I’m a key worker and have been vaccinated as have several members of my family, which has helped to ease anxiety. I’m still nervous about whether we will come out of this lockdown soon but seeing other countries return to normal has given me hope. I feel calmer and less stressed. My general feeling now is one of boredom. It very much Groundhog Day! I miss having choices at weekends and hate that my son sees so few people. 
I do feel positive about my son returning to school, this will help enormously as I have struggled watching him be lonely and not being able to do what kids should be doing. 
So overall I’m feeling that we have light at the end of this tunnel and that has helped improve my mental health. January and February were extremely tough months."
897,3,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,"I think it is largely overblown. While it is a highly infectious virus and has bought forth fatalities, I fail to see why it is being treated so seriously. I think the reaction from the public and government officials is too much, for something that will likely disappear in 3-4 months by itself. Thus, I'm quite relaxed about it, but for the most part simply don't care. Of course, I could be proven wrong in the future, but based on the statistics currently available, I don't think it is that series for me. For the elderly however, or those with pre-existing conditions, it is of course much more likely to lead to fatality, and for them I recommend staying at home until this crisis is over.",4,Relaxation,4,4,5,3,4,4,6,4,"I'm significantly more relaxed about the situation due to the rollout of the vaccine and the reduction of daily deaths from Corona in the United Kingdom. I think we're almost out of the lockdown and quarantine period as a result of that, and i'm generally relaxed about the situation now. If everything goes well in the UK, we should be out of lockdown by June and people's lives can go back to how it was pre-pandemic. This'll help people's mental state as well as repair the economical hardships it has caused on people and the state."
898,5,Relaxation,1,1,1,3,2,2,5,4,"I am not feeling anything major with respect to the Coronavirus situation. I am following government advice and staying at home and I believe that's all I can do. I do not necessarily feel anxiety due to the virus.  

I heard yesterday that one of my family friends' wife sadly passed away due to Coronavirus yesterday, and that made this pandemic feel real. I was taking it seriously, to begin with, but having it happen to someone you more or less know is frightening but it has not effected my mental state that much. I feel like if it happens, then it happens.",2,Sadness,7,8,6,7,9,2,6,1,"I am not very worried about corona as I feel like I won’t suffer with it to an extreme if I caught it. Many people I know suffered but overcame it. I still take precautions and completely avoid public transport. I drive or walk everywhere and feel okay about it.

I am fed up of the whole thing though, and can’t wait until it’s all over. I am fed up of the whole thing though, and can’t wait until it’s all over."
899,3,Relaxation,2,1,1,1,4,5,9,1,"I'm enraged by the government's mis-management of the testing that's needed.  We don't need an antibody test right now, we need to be testing for the antigen.  NHS staff first, patients second, key workers third, and nowhere on that list is politicians.  Nowhere.

I'm enraged by the promise of 100,000 tests a month for a test that doesn't exist in any meaningful way.

I'm enraged by the government's inability to tell the truth about the supply about ventilators, or to actually use the UK firms that could have started manufacturing them weeks ago but didn't because the government wasn't interested.

I'm frightened of my 73 year old partner getting the illness and dying.  He's in excellent health, but he's 73.  I'm a bit concerned that as a 63 year old getting it wouldn't be pleasant for me, but not as worried as I am about my partner's age.  

But mostly this evening while doing this survey I'm relaxed and very pleasantly tired. I've done a bit of cooking today, played tetris with the freezers, done a bit of gardening, fixed a couple of things, done a bit of voluntary remote working, walked the dog and had a thoroughly satisfying day.  I have no other concerns in the world, and as a result I'm very conscious that I'm in a privilged tiny, tiny, tiny minority and a very lucky woman.  I hate to admit it, but Lockdown seems very peaceful to me, with loud birdsong and no traffic.   ",8,Anger,8,7,3,3,9,5,5,1,"I believe the death toll from Covid-19 in the UK reached 120,000 today, or 140,000 depending on how these things are measured.  Our economy is f***ed, totally, by a government that has flung unimaginable amouts of money at every management consultant in the country, and a few in the USA, that between them haven't actually managed to come up with anything that has performed better than any other country, other than the roll out of the vaccine programme - and that was the NHS's responsibility, not management consultants.   I'm beyond enraged by the sheer scale of the incompetence and I will NEVER be reconciled to our failure.  How anyone can think Johnon's performance is acceptable is beyond understanding.  "
900,8,Anxiety,7,6,7,9,5,2,1,1,"I feel frustrated that there are still people not self isolating and not taking it seriously. I feel like there should be consequences for people who are still attending large gatherings and putting others at risk. I do not want to be in isolation for longer because others cannot follow instruction and stay at home. My grandparents are very old and so I cannot see them, I miss my friends and this is the longest I have been away from my boyfriend in three years. I'm scared that the people I love will get sick, my mum is a key worker so cannot stay at home so others that can should be doing there part.",4,Desire,2,2,4,6,6,7,5,9,"Still worried for the elderly but hopeful we can be safe when more people are vaccinated. I am looking forward to seeing family again and enjoying time with friends at a restaurant. I still feel like masks are needed and the thought of large crowds still makes me feel anxious, but I am more excited to go to the cinema and beach with my family. I miss day trips and garden parties and am excited for the summer. I do not feel like large gatherings such as clubs or festivals will be feasible any time soon. "

I am trying to use this time off to rest and recuperate but I’m finding it all so surreal and I feel like my mind is constantly racing - I don’t sleep later than 6.30/7am any more which I hate.

Almost, the shock was greater on the start of the pandemic than at the end still i believe.
I feel a little hesitant in moving forward but i believe it has to do more with my current situation than the pandemic. "

The uncertainty of unknowing when I will be able to pay for bills and direct debits without rationing my last of my wages. It’s hard to keep yourself occupied during this time as well when you’re in an unhappy household, avoiding family members and really being stuck to your bedroom.

Difficulty with everyone being at home and slacking so difficult to get in touch with tutors for work or asking for help is brushed aside often. Also being out of work for so long has been tough, very low income compared to usual and the struggle of getting by, mainly frustration that a year later we are still in the same position.

I'm angry that this was allowed to happen.  I feel better measures should have been put in place to prevent this.  

I worry that if/when things 'get back to normal' that it could happen again!  

Being at home all the time is becoming difficult.  My 7 year old son hasn't left the house for a few weeks now and I feel for him not being able to go to school, see his friends and play.

People are starting to do more and once allowed to by the government they will not hesitate to do what they did previously, before the coronavirus.   

I do believe there is a large majority of people who are not worried about the coronavirus and how it will affect them (maybe they haven't had any personal experience i.e. someone close to them dying!)  

This morning I took my son to school.  The lack of social distancing was a disgrace.  One example was a couple of mother's standing in the middle of the pavement, having a conversation with people struggling to get by them.   It's infuriating.  I could have started an argument with about 4 or 5 people on the walk to school.  

I can't stand the way these people are and how they are behaving. "

I’m also a bit frustrated that it seems like there are many other people who haven’t been following the rules and who continue to break them, which makes you wonder why we continue to follow them.

907,8,Anxiety,7,2,8,9,7,1,1,1,I feel extremely anxious about the situation and when it will end. I am worried about my elderly parents getting sick. I am worried I might stop getting paid the longer the situation lasts. I was in the middle of buying a house before lockdown and now I have no idea what will happen with that. It makes me worry about where my life is heading. I’m not in control of it now and it’s future is being changed because of a virus. I worry about the front line workers getting sick when they have no choice but to do their jobs; I have several friends who are medics. I am grateful for all the work they and other emergency workers are doing right now to help us all.,7,Anxiety,5,1,7,8,7,1,1,2,I feel anxious that it is affecting so many parts of my life. I feel even more anxious than my boss is expecting me to carry on as normal as work and break rules to do so. I am bored of life being this way and want to get back to some sort of normality. I am annoyed that I still follow the rules but others seem to do what they want to serve themselves. I am a little hopeful but still sceptical that the vaccine will help change things soon.

I have noted that quite a number of people are not observing the social distancing guidelines whilst I have been out for essentials and this leads me to becoming angry towards them. On a more positive note I have found the time stuck at home productive as I am able to catch up with things around the house and personally which I wasn’t able to previously due to a busy lifestyle with work.,4,Sadness,2,2,3,6,7,5,4,5,"I am a little happier with the current COVID situation compared to a few months ago as rates of infection and deaths are falling. Now that we also have a vaccine and it is being delivered with such great speed it means that some of my loved ones are now protected and in the next few months I will also receive my first vaccine thus giving me a greater peace of mind to their well-being. There is however, still an overall sadness at some of the losses we have all had to deal with both emotionally and financially and I am still very anxious about what the new normal will be and the long term effects this last year may have had on my children’s education and future job/life opportunities."

I miss playing football in my indoor league. It has not restarted since March 2020. I'm looking forward to it finally being allowed to resume.

I think that governments are starting to act more tactfully in combatting the virus and its wider effect on society and to communicate clearer messages and information to the public. However I strongly believe that the UK government did not respond efficiently to the virus' initial breakout.

I have a lot of anxiety every time i watch the news there's bad news, i need a bit of positivity on telly, I have anxiety about my rent will i be able to afford it next months? 

My mental health is deteriorating, i think it's a mix of not knowing what the future holds and if my saving will last till the Corona situation is over.

Also because i have worked and still working during this crisis, i'm worried that i might catch the virus, so everyday i'm extremely anxious.

 i'm fed up with the whole situation ,i just want things to get back to normal.

i'm anxious, worried about my job, my finances and my health as well.

As a sufferer of many mental health conditions being able to go outdoors and get out of the house is good for me. Being able to pop down to my friends house and see how theyre doing, going to the pub for food and drinks. Just normal activities I'd like back. The aspect of the virus itself doesnt scare me unfortuntely, but I am following the rules of self isolation like the law is currently stating. Just wish it was over so I could get back into work and a good head frame.",3,Relaxation,6,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,"I feel that its sadly gone on for too long shot he economical aspect is ruined as well as peoples mental health.

However, I have seen the effects of Coronavirus within my hospital and via the news. Seeing the devastating effects it has had on others has left me feeling very sad and wishing I could do more. I’m not anxious, or fearful per se, as I am confident we will be able to overcome this and gradually return to normal. It’s been really lovely to see the nation come together in such a difficult time and there is a real sense of community. ",2,Happiness,1,1,2,4,2,9,8,4,"I feel hopeful.

We have no savings and whilst I agree our combined earnings were more than perhaps some of my family and friends it was in no way above the national average and our our goings for bills is quite high. I’m also fearful we will end up losing our jobs and with the country on its knees economically I can’t see getting another job as an easy task.

I am sad as I miss my two young nieces immensely, we would look after them fortnightly whilst my sister worked and I miss them so much. At that age they change so quickly.

I am content that currently we have a nice house for me and my partner and my son to shelter in and that we have each other with no health issues yet but I feel guilt for feeling this when I do because of all the pain others are experiencing. I feel useless that I should be doing more to make a difference when it comes to my grandchildren one day asking me what I did I’ll only be able to answer stay inside. 

I feel fearful that we may catch the virus I get extreme anxiety food shopping it reminds me of an apocalypse.

I am anxious that we will be forced to go back into the office full time home schooling aside I have enjoyed working from home it’s saved so much money on fuel and childcare. In terms of the disease itself I’m hopeful I really believe in the vaccine, I caught corona virus in January of this year and although I felt poorly for 10 days I was okay and I’m kind of relieved it’s over and done with. I can really see light at the end of the tunnel with the relaxation plan the government has released it makes me happy to know socialisation will be back very soon I will be back to the gym it’s like the end of a dark period and I won’t take basic things like hugging relatives for granted again.

Some people don’t bother wearing them, some will wear them wrong with their nose out or them wonky and not properly covering the mouth and nose which is frustrating as all the nhs key workers have to wear them constantly all day! I wear one all day nearly every day and it’s not nice to wear at all it gets hot and horrible but we do it to save ourselves and other people and when I see someone not caring and only wearing a bit of it and not properly it does anger me as it’s such a simple thing to do and people can’t even do that!"

I wonder what the future looks like and how safe we will be going to pubs and on holiday. I think our children will remember this for the rest of their lives. 

This is history in the making. I used to feel special when I travelled to work throughout the first lockdown, it felt very different with empty trains, stations and streets.

However I do also believe that the country and world economy will eventually bounce back from this, but I do think that it will be a while until we see a full recovery.

The human race is great adapting to surviving against the odds and this is another factor that we will adapt to.

I am still unsure as to when the rest of the world will be able to gain some normality and boarders will be fully open like they were pre-pandemic.

It could take over a year until the whole world is back to what it was pre-pandemic.

I think vaccines are good and the only viable way out of the current situation. I am not too worried about mutations as I trust that the vaccines can easily be tweaked to deal with this, similar to the flu vaccine each year."

I do feel thankful that I can focus on the household jobs that I don't get time to do when I am working and I have time to be creative if i feel like it.

For the first time I fully support Boris Johnson and the policies put in place by the British government, I am thankful that our leadership appears to be basing their response on scientific data and common sense which appears to be wholly not the case, particularly for countries such as the United States and more extremely Belarus.

This is a marathon, i've adjusted to the situation (not much mind) but it is what it is, no need to get angry, annoyed, etc. Instead of life going 100mph, it's slowed time, given time to re-evaluate, think things and enjoy the more realistic things we have in life.

It’s the most worrying seeing news posts everywhere and being that so many different people and news outlets are reporting on it you don’t know who’s information is 100% accurate and what to believe! The other thing is that not everyone is following the lockdown rules and that obviously isn’t a good thing and is how the virus will be around for a lot longer and infecting a lot more people that it needs to.

I personally have not checked any news at all regarding the coronavirus for about a year just because it's very depressing and not the best for mental health.

Not only do I worry about me or a member of my household contracting the virus, I am worried about the implications social distancing may have if they are still in place for the baby's birth and newborn period.

COVID cases are falling every day and with the vaccination roll outs the risk is lowered for the most vulnerable. Life will soon be getting back to normal and that is very exciting to think about. There are no longer high deaths every day and hospitals seem to be able to cope better. We are in a much better place than last year and that has lowered my stress and anxiety around the whole pandemic. It seems like we have an end in sight and will soon be able to reunite with our loved ones and get our lives back to how they once were before the pandemic began.

I fear the public may soon begin to riot if the lockdown continues for longer than April, this would leader to further spreading of the virus and more deaths.

Over the last year there has been a lot of conflicting information. I've sort my information from medical experts but many people, who don't research, just get the conflicting information. This has lead to a distrust of facts. I've received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but I'm still fearful of possible infection, especially with new variants popping up. I've spent the past year locked indoors apart from medical appointments, this is due to being diabetic and vulnerable. I'm stressed, anxious and more depressed than normal.

The government has been too slow to lockdown and then kept us in lockdown for too long, causing far too much damage to schools, jobs and people’s livelihood’s.

I live with my partner and we get on very well so I have felt supported in that way, but feeling ever so slightly afraid every time we leave the house and not being able to see our friends is quite difficult. I think it feels almost like a grieving process. You can be distracted from thinking about it for a certain amount of time, and when you are reminded, all the fear and confusion and frustration comes back anew. I am worried for the economy and I'm saddened for people who will lose people or suffer, and for the NHS and its workers. I'm angry at the government for stripping back the resources needed to fight it, and for being lax at every opportunity. It feels very like we are helpless.

Stuck in a weird dichotomy of trying to relax and make the most of working from home and the opportunity that extra time presents, and the angst and fear of  losing work, possible health impacts on friends and family and having to survive on even less money.
This is amplified by the constant frustration that the truth surrounding government response is clouded in obfuscation and political games. 
I am generally skeptical of consensus and as we are presented with a narrative that suggests that we may harm ourselves or others severely If we choose to question the narrative, this presents a hard pill to swallow. As such I am finding myself immersed in the horrendous story as it happens, and simultaneously horrified by my complicity in my own mental torture.",5,Anger,7,3,3,5,2,4,3,2,"I'm mostly angry about the seemingly endless corruption and mishandling of the Covid response in the UK.

There's an anger at divisions that have formed in relationships with friends who have taken a polar opposite opinion of the crisis, and a deep sense of dissapointment at how opinions and behaviour have been dangerously manipulated.
I'm also a little nervous about things returning to normal as I've grown accustomed to the routines and restrictions we currently have. As someone with anxiety, the thought of social pressures returning is giving me frayed nerves."

My parents are both 65 so I'm aware they're slightly more at risk than I am, but they're both relatively healthy so I'm not particularly concerned.

I do have phases of feeling sadder or isolated, in balance with any cheeriness, and reading the news never helps with this, yet I can't help but scroll...

I work in public health so I'm acutely aware of my local situation but this is another cause for hope; I can see things are much better than they were in January simply from the number of outbreak control teams we have to convene. The workload remains humongous though, and many of us have lived and breathed covid for over a year now.

Lives are being put on hold (or sadly lost) and we have no idea when we will get back to 'normal' or what that will even look like. How long can people continue like this?

This time round I feel like the government have tried to ease restrictions over an appropriate length of time however there are still massive jumps between what is and what isn't allowed I am feel like the cases will not be low enough for these restrictions to be lifted - but they will be lifted anyway due to pressure from the public on government officials, which annoys me "

It is heartbreaking that many NHS and health professionals have lost their lives or been very ill with Covid. I do worry about the economic problems that the country now faces though and worry for many people who have lost their jobs. It has been a very worrying time for many people.

I feel like some people don’t understand that they may not be significantly affected by the virus but they can spread it to someone vulnerable.",5,Relaxation,5,3,5,5,6,5,6,3,"Before a lot of people were getting covid 19 and there was no solution for it so I felt very sad and anxious. However, now I feel relieved since millions of people in the United Kingdom are getting vaccinated furthermore the R value is below one at the moment. Also not only in the United Kingdom but a lot of people in the other countries are also getting vaccinated so hopefully the world will be free of the covid 19 virus.

I'm frustrated that the NHS has been so under funded, that the government for all they preach about helping the UK have done fuck all and it's mainly the NHS (Who they wanted to privatize) who are helping. I'm worried and stressed because of my family and friends in this situation, especially as I take care of my elderly dad. I'm fortunate to be able to work from home but I'm not in a great financial place, and honestly, just everything is horrible and some idiots don't seem to realize  they should stay inside for other people's sake.",3,Anxiety,1,1,1,6,2,4,3,1,"Whilst it is a point of concern, I'm tired. I have experienced lockdown for pretty much over a year, I have not seen my siblings as they live in a different county to me, I have seen my friends once, and the only time I leave the house is for shopping, a walk, or to go to work if an urgent face to face meeting is needed. I'm tired of the situation and I want it to be over. But not just lockdown over, I want the COVID gone so we can all live without this fear, I'd rather keep wearing the masks though as people are awful with their hygiene most of the time anyway. Tired is the best way to describe how I feel. "

Things look to be heading the right way in the UK at least, so I don't think it will be too long before things go back to 'normal'. Hopefully the death rate decreases in the following days and lockdown measures can be relaxed. Hopefully the virus can be stopped permanently with a vaccine and we won't have to live in a world where this is the new normal.",4,Sadness,3,3,6,6,8,4,4,1,"I feel less happy about the lockdown situation than previously, its starting to grind a bit now since the weather has been bad and going out for a walk and cycling is less of an enticing prospect. At first i didn't miss social occasions much but now i feel like i miss it, going for a drink with friends or going to a theme park seems like and exciting prospect.Im starting to look forward to the end and feel positive that that end is in sight. However its been a long time since 'normality' and it is going to take some ajustment to the new normal and what that looks like. Im concerened about vaccine availability and how far down the list i am when everything is starting to open up again and i will be expected to return to the office. While im looking forward to the future im still very much aware that the virus is around and before everyone is vaccinated it is a real threat, not just to the old and vulnerable but everyone."

I’m anxious cause I haven’t left the house in a year and I might have to soon… how am I going to cope with people again?

I’m hopeful that an end to this is in sight but also worried that the virus might mutate again, making the vaccine useless and enforcing a new lockdown."

I am staying at home with my family, have kept deliveries to food and essentials and have only left the house to deliver food to my parents and my mother-in-law, who are both on the extremely vulnerable list. 

I have been very angry in recent days at people who have been ignoring the social distancing rules - specifically my neighbour who had a small gathering (of at least three different households) in her garden at the weekend. It makes me very sad that some people have such disregard for others' health and safety.",8,Fear,5,5,8,8,7,3,3,3,"I feel very worried about the full reopening of schools on Monday. I feel that it is too soon, and that the government should be aiming for an elimination approach. I am fearful that other Covid variants will be given the opportunity to emerge, rendering our vaccines useless. I am very disappointed with our government for the way that they’ve handled this pandemic.  I wish I lived in New Zealand or had a Jacinda in charge of our government. Still, our controls over people travelling into and out of the country are too lax. To hear that nurses have been given a measly 1% pay rise after all of the work they have done throughout this pandemic, causing danger to both their physical and mental health, is appalling. "

",6,Anxiety,7,6,7,7,5,4,4,1,"At this moment I am anxious because we are exiting lockdown and when economy reopens covid will again spread to high levels of cases as has been proven to do before. There are new strain cases and no new guidelines for schools etc (my son is 5 and can still cuddle ALL his classmates). I feel there are too many of the public not adhering to the rules put in place to keep others and self safe. Schools run a major risk of transmitting virus as simply can't implement the safety needed, its nurseries and younger years having case loads. Cant expect older children and teens not to socialise closely either, its unrealistic. In my opinion there should be a lockdown style approach until everyone is vaccinated even if it takes a couple of years. Wellbeing may be affected but we are in a PANDEMIC so sacrifices for the long run need to be made. Going in and out of lockdowns with mass deaths and cases per time isn't doing any good. Problem with the UK is compliance, government don't know how to enforce as public have zero respect. 
Since the beginning and even now I was/disinfect products from shops, limit my outings to places like the shops (deliveries instead), have not seen friends and family properly in over a year, take my son to outdoor parks/public areas, my son doesn't get to play after school with anyone.. we do everything more than by the book to stay safe as son has asthma and I'm a smoker so our lungs not the best. Whats the point when half the public not even bothering and the government can't wait to reopen everywhere and end up back to square one? Thats where I'm at."

I am cross about anyone who persists in not taking this virus seriously. I'm really cross about people in positions of power who are not doing their job. I should have put the 'anger' slider on 9 but I feel so distanced from them it didn't seem honest. 
I also feel fatalistic. 
Sometimes I think this pandemic has been a long time coming.
Sometimes, I wonder if the virus is a 'natural' cull to give the planet time to breathe a little.
I also feel overwhelmed if I dwell on it all for too long, or read too much about it. 
I worry for the animals.
I hope that if we come out the other side, a better life for everyone will emerge.",5,Anger,8,8,5,5,2,3,2,2,"Confused and conflicted. Overwhelmed and past caring. Anxious and resigned. Deeply angry and disgusted by the government's behaviour, greed and corruption. Full of compassion for anyone who has to cope with the consequenses of Covid. Fatalistic.
I had my first jab yesterday. In the evening I had side-effects of very strong shivers and aches. A fitful night. Today I feel fragile. Someone told me the after-effects are worse with the second jab. 
The same person said they would have the vaccination; they distrust the information given and are wary of the lack of time over testing. They are sceptical of the Covid deaths numbers. This person owns a care home. 
The vaccination centre was so well organised and everyone was kind and helpful, I was impressed. Now, I find myself wondering if it's all a stage set. 
Throughout the pandemic, my motivation has been to stay out of hospital; to not add to the workload; to help the NHS and to look after myself. I didn't clap for carers - I think they should all be paid properly. The 1% payrise announced today is so depressing, mean, corrupt, greedy. I  can't help but loathe this government and all the people in power who are self-serving. I am angry.

I fear someone in my family could get the virus, I do have faith in thre government to do what is required but we need a full lockdown and only essential shopping for food. 

Sad about the PM going into intensive care, this is soo unexpected really hope he gets out of this asap.

I'm concerned about how long before its safe to travel abroad and it looks like the UK government acted too slow to put restrictions into place in airports, i honestly thought it was a forgone conclusion that we'd have put measure in place for international travellers much quickly. I also think its a huge mistake to open bars and restaurants when not everyone has had a chance to have a vaccine.

The vaccine rollout is going really well. That’s one thing the government have done well.

They did what was easy. And because of that all these people died. Some family got COVID and are still suffering from long term effects. Because Boris couldn’t do what was needed of him.

To stop the boredom I got  another job in a supermarket which was fine before the second lockdown but then people started to come in for a day out in large groups and not conforming to social distancing rules which Is annoying.

We’ve had Billions wasted on a private sector response that failed totally, contracts awarded without merit, and yet no money for health workers.

Lives were lost needlessly. And I think very few lessons will be learned going forward. One way or another we will be paying for this for a very long time to come, not just financially but in the numbers of people who will have to live with the after effects of Covid and a complacent government too inept and unwilling to appreciate the magnitude of their failure."

When will the lockdown end? But what happens then? How do we go back to normal? What will normal be? Will it ever go back to how it was before this? Will we ever be able to move as freely in the world again? These are all unanswerable questions at the moment but the most worrying questions of all. ",3,Sadness,1,1,2,6,7,5,6,1,"I am feeling okay regarding the situation as a whole, my family have all had their first jab so that has relaxed me about working in a school. However, I am now just feeling fed up and sad about staying inside and not being able to do things or go anywhere on my days off, even if that is popping into my village for a coffee. I am not angry any more about decisions made, I understand that it must have been hard to make decisions on something no one knew anything about, it is just annoying that decisions are still not being met (e.g. shutting of the borders), that could mean we can be 'free' for longer and safer. I personally would much prefer to travel within the UK and boost our economy if it meant there would be fewer lockdowns than to travel abroad. "
1033,3,Relaxation,1,1,1,2,2,7,8,5,I feel like the corona situation is on its way to being fixed. Everyone should stay home to help the situation. It is hard but everyone can do it. Everyone just had to find stuff to entertain themselves. The important thing is that everyone can help by just staying inside. We have a long way to go yet but the signs are good that things will level out and then improve. I suspect we’ll be social distancing for at least another month. I do worry about the economy but I think the government and everyone is doing the best they can. It is an unseen event so everyone is having to figure it out together. There’s been a lot of businesses doing what they can to help people; all the free exercise videos and people offering to get food for people that can’t get out. I hope this continues and the NHS gets more funding because this has proven how vital it is to the UK and how it is under funded. It will undoubtedly have put strain on a lot of relationships and people’s mental health but everyone can help to make it easier. If people don’t follow the lockdown guidances it will just get worse and it will all go on longer than is needed,3,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,2,5,6,5,I feel it is on its way to getting better. I think the corona virus is on its way out but I don't think life will be back to normal for a while. I have accepted that life will take a while to get back to normal so I am calm with it all. I just hope people don't go silly so that it takes longer than it should for things to get better. I think the world will take longer than the UK to get back to normal and that will set people back. I do worry about places that aren't taking the right action like Brazil as it slows the progress down.
1034,5,Fear,2,2,7,7,5,4,3,3,"Feel worried and scared for the future. It's good that the numbers are going down, but don't understand how we can then go back to normal without it returning? Feel I need to do more to help as I have been furloughed so have the time but then I also lack in motivation with just doing things at home. But that is not new for me. I feel lucky that we have a garden to go in and feel bad for those confined to small spaces and those on their own. 
Fingers crossed the numbers continue to go down and we can overcome this.",3,Desire,3,3,4,4,6,5,5,9,"I feel that there is light at the end of the tunnel and am counting down the days until the certain restrictions end such as when we can mix indoors and when shops/services open and 21st June. I feel happier now that most of the vulnerable have been vaccinated which hopefully should mean less hospital admissions if they did still catch it. I just really hope we don't get restrictions back or that they delay the dates they said we can do certain things, we all really need to get back to normal now. It's really important especially for family and friends to see each other, some people have been alone for far too long."
1035,7,Sadness,3,3,6,6,8,2,6,2,"My mood changes with the news of the day. Today I am a little more optimistic especially as the number of infections has dropped dramatically. I am not daft enough to show too much hope though as they could easily go up again. Last night I was very sad when I heard the PM had been taken to hospital. It also damaged my morale and I think if we were to lose him the country as a whole would take quite a hit.  I am fearful but try to keep that in check with logic. If the usual flu season casulaties were reported in the same way as this virus has, the figures would be much more scary. If flu was a notifiable disease then we would have lockdown just about every year.",2,Anger,8,8,3,2,1,5,5,4,"I am angry that it has been allowed to go on for so long. I am angry I have wasted a year of my life through governement and SAGE incompetence. I am angry that although there are thousands of respected scientists who have said we could have done everything differently they were never nced listened to because for the government to admit that would mean losing face. I forgive the reaction a year ago but within weeks most sensible people could see whilst this was a pandemic, it wasnt on the scale that it was reacted to. i saw with great sadness today on the news schoolchildren being taught how to take Corona tests and I was sickened to my stomach at the sight of this. There has been so much unecessary expense, effort not to mention the extra deaths that are coming down the line due to missed diagnosis and treaments, nto to mention the poverty when furlough ends and a million people are laid off, if not more. This must never be allowed ot happen again and there needs to be impartial enquiries with each death investigated as to whether c19 was their cause of death as we all know the vast majority died of other things. And when this data comes out and the mistake is revealed, no less than jail time should be meted out to Johnson Hancock, Whittey and all the others. i have already decided that unless there is a massive shake up I will never vote again. My faith in this government and this country as a whole (due to the stasi like orders to snitch and the bickering over distancing and masks etc) has never been at a lower point."
1036,8,Fear,5,2,8,8,8,1,1,1,"I am feeling very scared. Scared for my partner, for my children and for myself. I am paranoid about one of us catching it.  My OCD has intensified and my anxiety is spiralling out of control. I am petrified one of us will get ill. I am worried about losing money/jobs. I am struggling to cope with being in lock down.  If lockdown gets stricter I fear I will not cope.  I am so very sad for all of the lives lost and scared for all of the frontline workers battling to save everyone.  I can’t see a way out from this.",8,Anxiety,2,1,6,8,6,2,2,1,I am feeling burnt out and in desperate need of a change of scenery. I am hoping that virus levels will continue to fall so that lockdown measures can be relaxed and I can take my children to the woods or the beach. They need it for their mental health.  My family and I have stuck to every lockdown rule set and we are finding it increasingly frustrating seeing people break these rules - especially when we have sacrificed so much. I am trying to feel optimistic for the future but when I can receive the vaccine seems a long time away.
1037,7,Anxiety,2,4,6,7,6,3,4,2,"It’s a worrying time and brings out much anxiety. You realise how much you take for granted being able to see family and go out whenever you want. It’s also worrying in terms of work and economy - will small family run businesses survive? How long will it take them to build back up and can they with so many people losing jobs, losing income etc?
How long will we have to stay in lockdown? What will the impact be on many things. But it also brings out what people really feel and who are really important to them. You really do find out who your friends are and how very important your family are - staying in touch is so important.",5,Anxiety,4,3,5,7,6,4,5,1,"Still quite anxious about it. Happy that lots of people are getting vaccines and that it seems to be having an effect. But worried about what the last 12 months has left behind in relation to state of the economy, folk holding off seeing their doctor and therefore more terminal illness diagnoses, fear of going back to some sort of normality and not wanting everything back as it was. Looking forward to spending time with family and friends again. Have got used to working from home and hope this continues. "
1038,2,Relaxation,1,3,2,2,3,5,6,5,"I feel very relaxed about the situation. My immediate family are all at low risk. We are social distancing in the ideal situation, with a reasonably sized house and garden and no underlying health conditions. I feel mildly worried for my dad who is over 70 with high blood pressure and does not seem to be taking this seriously enough, but my overriding feeling is one of gratitude that my immediate family are in no danger and living comfortably. I am self employed and have slightly less work, but we have taken a mortgage holiday and our general outgoings are reduced by staying at home, so we don't have financial worries. I feel slight guilt that we are in such a fortunate situation whilst others are suffering and that I cannot volunteer for the NHS because my husband is already a key worker. I feel slightly sad that my children are missing out on their regular activities but aware that they are lucky to do them in normal times. I don't socialise much anyway so I am not really missing the social interaction. I feel I am in as good a position as it is possible to be in under the circumstances and I am grateful for that. ",2,Relaxation,1,1,2,3,2,6,7,6,I feel relatively positive about the fact that the vaccines are being rolled out and that the children are able to go back to school. I feel a mild amount of worry that everyone seems to think the schools will end up closing again and also that this could happen due to variants.  In general I feel happy that things are looking like they will soon be starting to get back to normal.  I'm in no rush to travel abroad but would love to have a normal summer being able to see family and travel within the UK.
1039,8,Fear,5,2,8,6,7,4,2,1,I am feeling calmer now we’ve been isolation for 3+ weeks but I feel so scared for family and friends. I continue to feel anxious about deliveries and the ‘outside world’ coming in to our bubble. I am in awe of those on the front line. Normally I am very impatient but I’ve come to terms with the fact this will be a long and painful process in many senses. I feel concerned for my son that this social distance will ostracise him from learning opportunities and the ability to socialise. At 2 years old I am relieved that he does not understand some of what he is missing out on. The only positive emotion comes from the opportunity to spend quality time together as a family without interruption.,7,Anxiety,4,4,6,7,6,5,5,3,I don’t want to relax. I feel happier now my husband is vaccinated. Strangely my anxiety and concern is about my family rather than myself. I feel angered about others relaxed approach. I’ve been angered by seeing neighbours out and about with covid. I’m excited about some sort of normality returning but equally this makes me thoroughly nervous. I think the government have had a hideous situation to deal with and no matter what they’ve done there’s always going to be people who disagree. I trust their choices even when I possibly don’t agree. I am nervous for the future. I feel it will be a very different place. I don’t see life as we knew it returning. I think this will permanently change society. In some ways for the better.

I am able to do my weekly shop at my local supermarket down the road which is not too much bother and I am making an effort to stay at home unless I go for a walk (once a day) or shop (once a week) so I feel happy as I can be in this scenario and happy to sit it out until we are allowed to go out more freely. I have concern and anxiety for the older people in our communities, particularly those more stubborn that insist on going out and popping to the shops several times a week putting themsleves and others at risk.  I appreciate not everyone is able to be too comfortable at home due to a variety of factors but I think its important for us to all make the best effort we can. ",3,Desire,4,4,2,5,2,6,6,8,"I am feeling optimistic.  Both of my parents have had their first vaccine dose and will hopefully receive the second within the next month or two.  When they are vaccinated I will feel even more at ease.  For myself, my partner and I both had COVID back in November 2020, although it wasn't great I, fortunately, did not have any serious issues. I'm really looking forward to travelling abroad again possibly this summer if it becomes possible.  I am also looking forward to getting vaccinated but I am most wanting the older people to get both of their vaccinations. "
1041,4,Anger,7,6,4,5,4,6,5,5,I think I have quite mixed emotions really. I am enjoying spending more time with my family. I don't really mind being stuck at home at all and I'm happy to use Facetime to chat with my extended family. On the other hand I'm really annoyed about the way NHS staff have been treated by the government and the hypocritical way they are being praised while being denied what they need to stay safe. I'm also quite fed up with social media and am making an effort to avoid it. There are too many people with misdirected anger - having a go at their neighbours.,4,Sadness,5,6,3,4,8,4,4,3,"I am tired of the continuing situation but also nervous that the few benefits that have come from it will all be forgotten or abandoned in the rush to get back to normal. I didn't trust or like the government before this situation and nothing they have done has changed my mind, but I'm sad that generally people don't seem to agree. It seems they could do anything and people would still vote for them. I've been very lucky in that I haven't lost anybody to this disease, which probably makes me a bit complacent."

This situation has given me the opotunity to become healthier as i am eating better and exersicing more in my garden, which is a positive outcome for this situation. I am only slightly scared for my grandma as she is alone and vunerable, but I know she will be fine in the end.",2,Anxiety,2,1,1,6,1,7,2,4,"At this very moment, I am quite frustrated with the corona situation, the government has not handled the pandemic as well as it should have. Being in lockdown is not fun and I would like it to be over soon. I'm anxious about how the situation has affected people close to me, as many people have had a much worse time than I have. However, I feel positive about the future, I believe the vaccines are effective and that enough people will take them so that we will be in a much more normal situation come the summer. "

I’m scared my elderly parents in Australia might fall ill and I’ll be trapped in the UK. I’m sad that my Pop in Australia is about to turn 100 and won’t be able to see any of his family. I feel sorry for the NHS workers who jobs place them in an environment surrounded by this virus. I feel safe in my little bubble, in my house, garden and local park but as anxious when the groceries are delivered. I am thankful I can still get deliveries. I’m thankful I gave birth three months ago when i could choose a homebirth with my family close by. I am happy when online purchases arrive as it feels like a slice of the normal but feel guilty that they may not be considered essential and are wasting the resources of the mail service.

Sad about the lives lost. I also feel fortunate to have a job, thankful for my family and a home. Because nurseries are open I have my sanity. I feel sad that as an Australian expat, my family hasn’t meet my 14 month old daughter and no idea when they will. I feel anxious about the vaccine shortage as I’m yet to get one. But I’m thankful my husband, who is a teacher, has had his. Mostly I feel like we’re all just waiting for life to restart.

I know it isn’t forever but it feels like it at times. I’m wanting everyone to take it seriously and stay at home so we can get over this quickly. 
This whole situation is making me depressed. Social media is not helping as all the celebrities are living their fancy lifestyles and separated from normality.

I am still hesitant to go about normal activities due to me trusting those out there to follow the rule as I do not believe many have. I'm sad a lot of things have happened over the year, it has been an extremely tough year for me and been a struggle at times. There have been few happy periods and I can't wait till things improve so I can feel happy again. Overall I am feeling hopeful for the future but that is in a year or so. "
1045,8,Fear,7,7,9,8,8,2,4,2,I feel afraid for myself my friends and my family. I hate being under house arrest but understand the reasons why I have limited movement. I am very angry that the UK government are still allowing foreign nationals to enter the UK whilst this is going on as it defeats the object of doing all this in my opinion. I am not sure when all this is going to end but I get the feeling late June/July is the first time I am going to see a resemblance of normality. I am glad that at least on my weekly trip to Tesco's that the shelves are now returning to normal and that people have stopped panic buying items which was just totally stupid.,7,Desire,2,1,3,4,4,7,8,8,Both myself and my husband have had the first covid vaccination and that gives me piece of mind and i am looking forward to part 2...the UK government are hoping to open the country up completely June 22nd and i am really looking forward to it.

But little things like that seem to irritate me more than usual. I feel annoyed and sad as well as worried my ocd will go through the roof when the restrictions are relaxed. My cousin and aunt work as nurses in a badly hit hospital so i am concerned for them and my elderly grandma they visit to give shopping to.  I am hating being cooped up with my partner who im arguing with more than usual as he is snapping and being horrible more than usual which stresses me out as usually i am very laid back.

Money is the biggest issue. I feel that the pandemic has really highlighted a lot of health problems within our society. I am not concerned about catching the virus as my age group is low risk. I am hoping lockdowns end very soon as i feel mental health problems are much worse than covid19 in the long run and society will have more poverty as a result. I also feel fed up and tired and unmotivated and stressed as a result of lockdown and the media scaremongering and people being hysterical and over the top whenever someone disagrees with them on the topic.

I feel like the Government are being evasive about the Prime Minister being in hospital which is making me worry that perhaps the situation is being worse than we are being led to believe. I am also very stressed at how NHS workers are unable to access equipment and tests when more well known people are able to access them with what appears to be very little effort.
I worry for self employed people at this time and the support they are getting and I am angry at big companies with rich owners who actually have the capacity to help but do not.",6,Anger,8,6,5,9,6,4,4,7,"I am currently feeling very frustrated at how this situation has been handled and it feels like there is still no clear end in sight.

I feel like the government has been so slow to respond to everything that it is now making the situation drag along even longer than necessary. I am frustrated at seeing how my friends in Europe seem to have more form of a life - even though they have curfews they can still see people in small groups and have some form of social life. I also feel like ordinary people are being blamed instead of being empathised with what is a very difficult situation.

It’s just a bit of nightmare and friends that are ill and family we’re worried about. This is just a really hard time right now for my friends and family.

I also feel that not everybody understands how serious this situation is despite schools being closed and only essential services being open and continuing to run. It makes me angry that people are risking the lives of vulnerable and elderly people just so they can try and continue their lives as normal, which makes the quarantining that everybody else is doing obsolete.

I recognise that the end may potentially be in sight and this makes me happy and has given me motivation to carry on with life. The pandemic has made my studies difficult and I wish that normality would resume so that my education can be unaffected. "

I think the financial measures to protect jobs, encourage workers to stay home, and assist people to pay bills must go further. I am very worried for those in the health service, particularly due to the shocking lack of PE and ventilators, which is at least partly due to the failings of Conservative governments to fund the NHS and other public services.

I feel hopeful that we will be able to stick to the timeline for coming out of lockdown and that things will return to normal soon.

We are lucky that our house and garden is big enough to keep us occupied, so in a way this feels like a holiday right now. We have quite a few major projects lined up doing things we have been meaning to do for ages. Now we are basically forced into doing them to use the time gainfully.

I am angry with this government, actually with the whole western world, for not taking it seriously enough at the beginning which I think is the reason or the mess we are in today.

I have food and supplies at the moment although I am concerned about the thought of having to venture outside should I need to buy anything from stores. The last time I went out to the shops, over a week ago now, there were large queues outside every one. Most of the anxiety stems from the behaviour of other people and my distrust of them. Anytime I have either visited shops or had an online delivery to my home, there have been items unavailable due to the ridiculous stockpiling of others.

We have found new ways to connect as a household too so we are all trying to find the positives in this anxious situation. We are playing scrabble and doing plenty of outdoor games in the garden.

We can go for walks straight from the front door, shopping is sometimes less straight-forward, in terms of what's available, but... we can cope. My 85 year old mother is in touch with me, she's ok.

And although there are promises of lifting restrictions, I'm deeply cynical about how much will actually be lifted. Three weeks to 'flatten the curve' turned into months, then back into more lockdown; 'the vaccine will turn things around', except that actually, the vaccine hasn't changed anything, and won't change anything.

I will be staying in until I have had both doses of the vaccine. It feels like a lot of people might act irresponsible when restrictions start to be eased and that makes me anxious.

The worst thing is no one really does know how to solve the situation and it feels like nationally not everyone is pulling together. I'm also worried about my family and friends as no one is immune yet people seem to think they are. Tense, anxious and dazed. Doesn't help when you've said pretty much everything and getting pushed for 500 characters in a survey - so add irritable to that too! My fuse is definitely shorter at the moment ",4,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,2,8,8,6,"I now feel optimistic and positive we will be through this by the end of the year - and at least to some sort of normality. I'm hopeful we are through the worst, especially with the vaccines and falling cases/hospitalisations. I'm looking forward to travelling again, seeing my friends and family. The only worry I have is will this happen again, what if we end up in the same place as before and things will never get back to normal. This means I have some anxiety still but less so than before. I'm trying to look forward, not look back and be optimistic."

I have been working so hard to save some money and I am afraid that I may loose it all now. I has become really depressing that I can't spend too much time outside and I have to stay at home instead.

I am also frustrated that I can not spend time with my friends.  The only thing we can do at the moment is going to work. That makes me angry and very tired.

I think the teachers unions have caused the situation and are using covid as an excuse to not be in school.  Every other profession is continuing even with risks so why not schools.

My job is secure so not too concerned about that, athlough it has been very difficult to home school and work fu time.

Upset with the losses from the virus but glad lots of people have managed to recover. Disappointed action wasn’t taken sooner by the government to contain the spreading earlier on to prevent such losses and intense lockdown measures. Upset I can’t enjoy the sun with my friends back at university and spending times at pubs. Hopefully the level of testing increases and the NHS are able to get the PPE that they need to avoid any chances of caching the virus.,3,Sadness,4,4,2,2,6,4,3,1,"Saddened that this has been going on for a year and measures were not put into place earlier or reduce the number of cases and deaths. Disappointed in the government for making silly rules that people don’t follow because the government haven’t been clear and concise with their rules. annoyed that young people get the blame when the government issues eat out to help out, and then didn’t think any bad repercussions would happen when everyone was allowed to go outside. Bored by the constant messing around by what we can and can’t do at certain points"

If I never hear the word bubble, covid, mask, lockdown, tiers it would be far too soon . The impact has been huge and yet the government and schools want us just to carry on as though we don’t need to process the hideousness of the past year "

The situation has made me realize how fortunate I am. I have picked up playing base guitar again shortly after the lockdown started, which has given me tremendous pleasure. 

I don't have any difficulty in the daily lives in the lockdown. If anything, I will probably be able to save a bit as I don't go out and spend money. The only thing that gives me anxiety is my parents' health. They are in a foreign country facing a serious outbreak, and I feel that the measures taken by the government are not restrictive enough. ",4,Anxiety,4,4,6,6,4,6,5,5,"I hope the situation will improve very soon, due to the global vaccination effort. When this started, I didn't think it would affect me so much because I was able to (luckily) retain my job, and I was not an outgoing person to enjoy outdoors anyway. However, after a year, I can see that it has taken a toll on my and my family's mental health. What is especially daunting is the fact that I cannot travel internationally to meet my parents. I am also concerned about the increased incidents of racism against people of Asian descent."

I do not blame Chinese citizens, who are the victims of their own government, I blame the government's irresponsible handling of not continuing to ban specific market practices. This is yet another situation where China failed to fix a problem; in the past proclaimed that these markets are banned, yet it's blatant that they have not been with this virus occurring. In response to the virus, I am disgusted WHO is backing China when refusing to oppose pro-CCP sensitive questions, and possibly manipulating statistics. The victims of this situation will die in cases beyond the virus, where vulnerable populations will be hurt, once again, due to irresponsibility. I am sickened by thinking of the world post-Covid19. All those with lost jobs, regulations being placed when nobodies paying attention, increase of poverty and wealth displacement. There's too many thoughts and feelings, though sadness and repulsion seem to be the easiest way to define how I feel.",3,Anxiety,6,7,5,7,7,6,5,5,"I currently feel a lot of resentment towards all the individuals who chose to not believe those who were thing to help them through this. All the scientist and health professionals who worked so hard to solve this, who had their progress stunted by people who didn't believe in them. It will be 2 years of my life taken away from me due to the inefficiency of others, meanwhile those people continued to see anyone they wanted to. I lost my grandfather, uncle, and my childhood cat during this time - all while being unable to visit my family abroad during this time. I am anxious because maybe there's a chance others will get over this sooner than I will - I feel stunted by all of this. I do NOT blame quarantining and isolation for this, as things could have been done better. "

So the anxiety remains. I am cross that the situation has not been managed well, but realise that the correct methodology for handling it will only become evident in hindsight. That does not relieve my anxiety. I particularly feel empathy for those who are suffering worse than I did. Most of all, I am anxious for my family members - especially my children and their children.",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,2,9,9,2,"I feel that the situation has been handled very badly. Even in Jan 2020, I knew that I should make my priority the wearing of a mask, and the need for social distancing. In Feb I was wearing a mask when travelling on the train. At first we were told categorically that we shouldn't be wearing a mask. Even those with a modicum of common sense would realise that wearing a mask would protect one from aerosol transmission. I feel that the mask instructions will end up being the big scandal of the pandemic. "

But in the meantime, there is a lot of uncertainty and this concerns me. One positive is that I feel the Corona situation has forced everybody to slow down, to spend time nurturing new and old relationships and to evaluate what is most important to them. I feel terrible for the people badly affected and fear that they could happen to me or those close to me. I hope and pray for this to be as over as quickly as it started and wish that it was possible for clearly defined timescales so that we knew what we were faced with.

I am sad at the thought of whether life will ever be the same again and I miss spending time with family and friends. 
I hope that things will return to normal and we will be able to forget the past year. I am also shocked that the situation has lasted as long as it has. It is hard to believe that we were previously able to do as we liked without rules in terms of socializing, eating out and earning a living. "

I have experienced 2 losses in January this year, 1 of which was caused by covid.

It is all getting better, but I am scared that with dates of easing now in place, people will just stop putting in effort and make these dates be prolonged even more.

I see parents having chats on the playground and not social distancing.  I’m fully aware that the risks are still there however it’s been going on for so long now that I’m willing to handle the risks. I just want life to go back to normal.

For once I agree with Trump that the Coronavirus cure cannot be worse than the problem itself"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

It will be very hard for young people whose education has been disrupted and their hopes for jobs in the future are grim. I think there are a lot of mental health problems developing as well. I don't believe the government know what they are doing! They have made bad decisions all through the last year. I believe they should now reduce restrictions sooner than planned. A lot of money and effort has been put into saving the lives of the elderly and the obese, now the government should think more about the younger people."

At this time of writing, the prime minister is in intensive care and this only adds to my worry. I have underlying health conditions so I’m being very careful but I’m also adamant to get my outdoor exercise in daily.

I’m working from home currently which is challenging but define achievable. ",5,Sadness,7,7,1,9,9,1,1,1,"I am not afraid of getting the virus but I am afraid of how it has changed the world.

I have been working from home for a year now. My apartment is very  small and some days due to the volume of work I have I do not get to leave the house for air.

My sister works in the NHS as a home carer, visiting people in their homes, which puts her at tremendous risk. Personally, my finances are in a bad state of affairs as I work in entertainments and have had no work at all for several weeks and no income. I'm struggling to pay for food.
The lockdown itself hasn't bothered me too much, I've been able to keep myself busy so far, but the general anxiety of the growing crisis edging ever closer to my life is causing me some distress.",7,Anger,9,8,7,5,8,4,5,2,"At the every beginning of the crisis I had fears over whether or not the government was capable of handling the situation effectively, whether the people who were tasked with taking charge of the official response and protecting the population as much as possible would be up to the task. I liked to think that at the very least they would be able to make the most basic efforts of minimising transmission as much as possible
As I sit here almost a full year later having lived through the crisis as it unfolded, the overwhelming emotions I have right now are very much anger and disgust. I believe that the government had the information they needed about the potential issues that Covid could create, but at this point it's clear that they chose to ignore the people who were advising them and pursue a dangerous course of action that has resulted in one of the worst infection and death rates in the world. Inactivity at critical moments, conflicting information, late decisions and bad judgment all contributed to what has turned into what feels like a complete failure of governance.
Not only that, but they have actively used the crisis as a means to award lucrative Covid-related contracts to personal friends and associates, often without any service or materials coming back in exchange.
Now my greatest fear is that the amount of time between the first and second stages of the vaccinations - more time than recommended by the vaccine makers and industry experts - could potentially create the perfect environment for a resistant strain to develop, alongside the mutations we're seeing appear.
As a person who contracted a moderate Covid infection over Christmas I can confirm that this feels different to anything I have ever experienced before, and almost three months later I still have minor issues occasionally as a result. I believe that this could all have been avoided to a large extent, but for the decisions and actions of the very people who we trusted to make competent and wise choices on our behalf."
1097,6,Relaxation,3,5,6,6,5,8,6,4,feel like people do not realise the magnitude of what staying in can do to help slow down the rate of cases. the government have put in measures but they arent that serious in comparison to other countries such as Germany who are taking it much more seriously. my grandma has recently been diagnosed with the cvoid-19 and she has only has contact with a few carers who come to her house to look after her. this has made me a lot more anxious about how cvoid-19 can affect the people in your family who you didn't think could get it that easily.,2,Anxiety,3,4,4,6,7,3,4,3,currently i feel frustrated at the fact that i cannot see my friends and i feel like my mental health is suffering greatly because of that. the reason i need to see my friends is because i am going through a very rough patch and i need to have people to talk to semi regularly. i feel like problems with peoples mental health are going to last much longer than the pandemic situation. this is why i believe restrictions should be eased and if you really don't want to catch covid then you should stay inside. i also think its awful that students are getting a lot of blame for covid when they have just done exactly what university and the government has told them to do

Looking at the effects worldwide makes me worry it will have a lasting impact on the world as a whole when it's over, catastrophic potentially. Could compare it to a world war in thirty years time. Right now my biggest fear is spreading it to someone else. I may have already caused the death of another human being in this outbreak. Makes it very hard to muster the courage to go out to even get essentials, I've been tempted to try and get deliveries for the foreseeable future.

They spread lies and they are as bad as social media with the false information going around.

People don't seem to understand the social distancing methods, i have even walked down a path to get essentials and two police have walked passed me next to each other when they could have just walked in single file down the small path. People in general are idiots here in the uk, sunbathing in parks and not taking the issues seriously.

The uncertainty of when the lockdown will be over is very draining and the inability to move about freely makes me feel depressed. I also feel fear for myself and immediate family as the survival rate are not great.
Watching television all day and sitting in the garden doesnt feel fulfilling enough and my inability to go to work and interact physically with my colleagues at work is demoralizing. I worry that this will not go away in a few weeks",7,Desire,1,1,8,9,5,3,2,8,"I can describe how I feel with 3 words. Scared. Anxious and Hopeful 
I am scared because there are new variants of the virus. Anxious about catching the virus and how vulnerable my I and my family members are and also Hopeful as there are promising vaccines available now to at least give us a fighting chance.
I am nervous about Potential Side effects of the vaccine as very little is know about them.
The government says its sage but where are they pulling their data from. I wonder. I worry about the long term psychological effect the lockdown will have on myself, my kids and the nation as a whole and I look forward to be able to travel again and hug my family"

I am very scared that my youngest daughter would become ill and have to go to hospital without me. She would be terrified. I feel very upset that people are being asked to sign DNR forms if they are deemed as less valuable than other people. This is immoral. I feel very anxious going out weekly to do the shopping and hate mixing with others in public.

They will never get this time back and have missed so much. 
I am also filled with anger and disgust at the corruption,  greed and immorality of our government. There is no forgiving their profiteering from this pandemic and their contempt they have shown normal families especially disabled people. They think disabled people are valueless, disposable. They think nurses are cannon fodder. They get rich off the misery and pain of the people they are elected to govern, protect and serve. I am filled with despair for the lack of decency and goodness shown by the people who have such power in this country"
1102,8,Anxiety,6,5,9,8,6,4,3,4,This situation is quite worrying as I do not know when this virus will end. I am very curious about this virus as I want to know how this will be suppressed and this actually started. Anxiety has taken over me as I have no idea when I could go back to work and earn money to provide for my family. What will happen if this virus continues? Supermarkets are calming down and tissues are available now. I feel as if I am stuck in a box and the walls are closing in. I am only allowed to do outside for essentials and this is taking a toll on my whole family.,3,Relaxation,3,4,5,6,4,7,8,7,I feel more at ease. The prime minister Boris Johnson has stated that lockdown will end by the 21st of June. This has slightly improved my mood about the virus as I have closure about the lockdown. I don’t fear the virus as much as I used to as everything is starting to die out such as cases but there is a bit of fear in me that there is a possibility that the virus could mutate and be more dangerous this could result in more cases and more deaths which in theory would put us in a another lockdown and would be an endless cycle. But at the moment I’m feeling quite happy and well.
1103,5,Anxiety,3,3,6,6,6,5,4,2,"While still generally anxious about the situation, at this very moment I feel relatively calm. I have been very up and down during lockdown and can go from feeling OK in the morning to very worried, sad or anxious by the afternoon. I read about some nurses and a surgeon who died this morning and that made me feel really sad and worried for staff that are on the front line. I have periods of extreme worry about older relatives but don't worry so much about me or my husband getting it. I have been angry about people who are flouting the rules. I find the whole thing very surreal.",3,Relaxation,1,1,2,2,2,5,6,5,"I think I'm acclimatised to the lockdowns and restriction of freedoms to the extent that if everything were to open up to quickly it would make me anxious. In terms of the disease, the vulnerable people I know are being vaccinated quickly which makes me less worried than I was last year. I have received both vaccinations due to my job so I am pleased about that. I would like to be able to plan things and travel but I am prepared to wait until it is safe to do so although I do find this frustrating."

Living day by day is better than trying to focus on the longer term and finding small tasks to complete to bring a sense of success and achievement are important. Each day I go to bed later in a bizarre attempt to delay the coming of the next day and all the headlines of more infections, deaths and stories that the day surely brings. Daily conversations - and especially video ones! - with people are a real lifeline. Fake news worries me enormously. In a way I feel 'safe' in lock down and I worry more about all that comes next.",6,Anxiety,5,4,6,8,8,1,1,2,I have a constant feeling of underlying anxiety and uncertainty. I can’t quite place what the anxiety is but have a feeling of an impending doom the whole time. I feel immense relief in moments when I process that nothing bad is happening but then I slip back. I am definitely anxious about returning to crowds and commuting. I spend more time now analysing and feeling bad about gaps in my life than ever before. I realise I have not felt happy or with joy for a very long time. I feel less anxious about the virus itself and more about the longer term impacts on society and the economy and the impacts on children. I am more aware of the vulnerability of older relatives and this makes me more anxious about time apart or disagreements over issues such as brexit and politics.

I'm scared for my own family and my own health, not just for the sake of COVID but if something else were to strike one of us or myself, that appropriate help would not be available. On top of this, I still have the workload and responsibilities of a young student who recently got a car and flat, my MOT and tax (despite being new to me) is due during lockdown, which brings me to one of my final points and feelings, general confusion towards what the government is advising - there has been varying contradictions from the government on what we should and should not do. And I don't like such leniency in some cases (such as my non-essential worker father still being loopholed into doing work) and strictness/being difficult in others such as my MOT and tax situation.

I don't really go out to try and protect myself as best I can, I feel isolated and longing to start my therapy again to get out and about and travel, but I can't do that with COVID in my area. I live in scotland, and I feel scotland handled COVID better than england, however we're still their doormat, and english people are still allowed into scotland to spread the results of their poor policies everywhere. It's really not fair, and I wish we could just close our borders solidly until it's really gone from england and scotland."

I am also a bit lonely as I have had to cancel plans to see my friends and family due to the outbreak. 
Finally, I am really nostalgic about things that I used to enjoy before, while now I feel like I am missing out on experiences. 
Surprisingly, the experience of being so restricted makes me feel grateful and appreciating of everything that I was able to do before the lockdown.

However, I think this is a fake sense of relaxation as there is still risk of COVID which makes me more anxious. I am also worried about life getting back to normal now that the pandemic is almost over. I now worry about not being worried enough about the virus. However, I am still concerned about restrictions which prevent me from seeing my friends and family. Still my main concern is the health and wellbeing of my family. I also continue to worry about spreading the virus without realising. "

I'm nervous that I and people I care about will catch it if people continue to ignore warnings and go out. People that continue to go out when completely unnecessary represent the worst of our society in my opinion and further restrictions should be put in place to deter these people and punish them when or if they breach the rules.  Its a very serious situation and people aren't taking it seriously, especially America that has a huge population that aren't receiving treatment quickly enough. Governments need to do more to protect and care for its citizens.",7,Anger,7,6,8,7,8,3,1,6,"I'm angry and frustrated that the government's incompetence has cost us our lives and freedoms. We shouldn't have had to give up nearly 2 years of our lives to begin with. I can't wait for the lockdown to end so I can finally get on with my life. The people not following the rules are ruining it for the rest of us. Many of us have given up luxuries and freedoms to keep our loved ones, and the loved ones of others, safe during this horrible time. Why can't the selfish few do the same? I don't expect it to snap back to normal right away, but I want the end of lockdown to come soon. It cannot come soon enough."

I have worries about what would happen if members of my family were infected and needed hospital treatment, as the situation there seems very bad. I am also concerned about how this is going to affect my university studies and the uncertainty around my assessments is causing me anxiety. But I feel fairly relaxed about the lockdown measures that are in place and don’t find them too difficult to manage or too restricting. However, if the situation worsens and further limitations need to be put into place (e.g no exercise outside of the home) I would find this very difficult and restricting. This worries me as I don’t think people are following the guidelines appropriately.

But most of my immediate family Have been vaccinated or will be vaccinated very soon which was my main concern and so a large proportion of my worry has subsided. As the infection rates are so low in my area this also puts my mind at ease. I still find myself paranoid about cleaning surfaces/deliveries though and I will not be happy meeting with anyone until my family have built up immunity from the vaccine.
1109,7,Fear,2,2,7,6,4,4,3,5,"I feel that we are in a very delicate situation right now. The pandemic is really hitting hard in most parts of the world. I fear for my family, where some of my relatives don't have a choice but to continue working. They are at high risk of contracting the virus. This makes me feel fearful half of the time. 

Personally, with the UK going in lockdown, it is the correct decision, but I do feel a little trapped and lonely right now. I feel that I can't escape my home and I hope this changes soon.

Moreover, we're financially unstable as I'm not currently working and haven't been on furlough (up until today).   ",6,Anxiety,1,1,6,6,3,5,5,3,"I am more relaxed now compared to a few months ago, as vaccines have started to be administered throughout my country. I am still worried about the spread of new variants of the virus, but I'm mostly more optimistic about the direction we are heading to eliminate COVID-19. 

At this moment, I'm still worried about loved ones who are vulnerable to the effect of the virus and ones that work for the NHS. I know some acquaintances who have been affected by the virus and people who have died from it, so I have taken extra caution to ensure I can minimise the chances of contracting it and spreading the virus to vulnerable people within my family and within my local community. 

I have taken a very cautious approach to the outbreak and have mostly reduced my hours at work. "

When I lived in the city I thought I could feel its entire population tense in fear of the lockdown, the death rates.
I have lost some of that acute fear and anxiety now. I feel guilt to the friends still in the city that are locked down, and struggle to be understood by anyone in my town, since none of them experienced lockdown whatsoever. 
I am worried about the state of the world, of the mental health of so many many people. I worry about the pandemic fatigue creeping in- how people tell themselves it's safe just because they're tired of the situation. "

Holidays cancelled, birthdays affected. I am very worried about the health and wellbeing of my family and friends who are all compromised due to underlying health conditions. People are not following the rules of social distancing and believing it's just the flu. Needlesly risking other people's lifes due to their own ignorance and stupidity. It has been difficult trying to get time off work in order to self isolate so as to protect my family. I'm lucky I work in a sector that can continue to provide a service during this time (therefore my job is safe) but they are making life difficult by not providing us with proper protection from Covid-19 other than wash your hands and here's some antibacterial wipes.
The economy is going to tank again just as I was starting to gain my feet from the last financial crisis in 2008 which hit a few months after I finished high school. Stronger sanctions should have been in place weeks before the where to try and minimise the disruption to the world. All travel from hotspots banned, people quarantined for 14 days, large gatherings cancelled sooner. Hopefully lessons will be learnt for next time. The only glimmer of light is that people are helping others in need. I hope this can continue long after this is over.",7,Anger,8,6,7,6,8,5,3,1,"I feel angry that we are still in a desperately sad situation over a year later after the initial outbreak. Certain decisions that needed to be made quickly where not, such as quarantining visitors to the UK. This annoys me greatly as we wouldn't have to be living with such extreme restrictions at this moment in time.  I also think we need to come down harder on those who are breaking the rules and not wearing masks without good reasons. Unless the person has a valid medical reason not wearing a mask should have a bigger fine that what it does now. I am also upset about my future as frankly I don't know how I am supposed to progress in my career and life when it is constantly being put on hold. "
1113,7,Fear,6,3,8,7,7,3,3,2,For me it's scary. We have to fight with an invisible enemy. At the same moment we have to sacrifice the economy to save people. Many people will die because of situations connected to the virus like clough in the healthcare or economic issues. Closing people at home hits their mental health. Many people are not prepared to spend that much together. Many businesses will go bankrupt. The world as we know now will never come back. I wish people are less reckless and take more seriously this situation. We need to stand together to overcome this issue. I also wish British goverment had reacted faster to the problem.,3,Relaxation,2,6,4,4,1,4,7,4,"I think it's a dangerous thing but we shouldn't ruin the economy and lives because of that. We should protect those who are the most in the danger and keep the world going. There are anxieties and many other mental issues which are coming from being in lockdown. Also, I feel that many people who should give us the example break the rules while they tell people to stick to them. It makes people thinking about strange theories and not follow rules at all. 
I can't wait to come back to normal life. I don't think coronavirus it's a hoax but now I think that we just overreact. "

The effects of this will be long lasting as so many have lost family and friends. Jobs and livelihoods don't exist. The government have done such a poor job to date. I can't imagine another lockdown.

I normally suffer from health anxiety so for me a global pandemic is the worst possible thing that could be happening
I am extremely worried about catching it, and worried how we will get out of the lockdown.

Right now it feels like things are getting a lot better with new cases and deaths coming down and quick vaccine rollout.

I feel safe and am not worried for myself in terms of catching corona, however I worry for people I know, in particular elderly family relatives who are much more likely to be affected by COVD.

I’m stressed also because even though I am at home I am getting a lot more uni work than usual to do, which still has to be handed in by the same deadline.

As these departments and people are employed to stop/assist in these outbreaks they are now culpable for the deaths, along with the Chinese area of Wuhan for allowing this atrocity to spread world wide. It appears at least there is evidential e-mails showing the head of the Control Disease Centre (CDC) dismissed the outbreak as only an extended strain of the common flu.

Feeling very sad and have no desire or energy.  Have only left apartment for food, do not like being in contact with large groups of people.  Wear a mask everywhere I go and clean my hands constantly, am upset when watching news reports on covid"

My partner was showing all signs of the virus so we self-isolated before being told. I never had any symptoms at all. So now, we're thinking did she have it or not. Testing shouldn't be so hard to sort out.
I do think now the knock-on effect will be that funding for research might be pushed to the forefront now its affected the rich and the trade in wildlife be frowned upon.  Feeling ill not being able to go out for exercise.  ",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,2,4,2,4,"It was to be expected. Surprised it  never came sooner. You'd hope now more funding would be there for the medical and sciences but that wont happen unless there is money to be made. Personally it hasn't effected me much, i did lose alot of work but i found other things. Never been worried about catching it. Im asthmatic so i should be buy ive allready lived through bad lung infections and id hope the next would finish me off. There are too many humans on this planet we deserve well most of us everything thats coming unless we come together  put greed aside and work towards a better future."

Being in lockdown is manageable although difficult as I normally use my friends and busy university life to keep my mind busy most of the time, so being isolated has had a slight negative effect on my mental health but I am doing my best to deal with it. The only anger I feel about the situation is perhaps how the government handled this originally (but they're better now) and the people who ignore the lockdown rules who I feel are very selfish in a time like this.  ",6,Anxiety,4,1,3,6,4,6,7,3,"I am more concerned that the government still isn't handling the covid situation well than I am about actually catching the virus myself. The idea that we could be put in another lockdown after the current one worries me especially with the amount of vaccines and time that has gone into trying to return life back to normal. Although I understand it is a horrible virus that has affected people all over the world, I haven't personally had it nor anyone else I'm close with, the main way I've been affected is since last March I've only been to my university once for a practical and so my education has been negatively affected."

I feel sad for those who have lost loved ones, especially when I hear of front line workers losing their lives. 

I feel further away from my family than ever before. 

I feel like I'll be judged when I leave the house, even though I am only going out for legitimate reasons. 

I feel angry at stupid people who carry on sunbathing in parks and visiting friends. I also fee angry at people on the street or in the supermarket who don't try to keep their distance.",7,Anxiety,6,4,4,8,6,5,3,2,I feel frustrated that it is still affecting our lives so strongly. I am also frustrated that the government bumped my health condition (asthma) from Group 6 in the vaccines. I'm sad my family couldn't visit the country this year and anxious because I don't know when I'll be able to see them again. I am also bored of working from home as I feel very isolated from my colleagues and not part of the team.

It feels like everything comes with an estimation or a guess, which fluctuates and causes uncertainty. In relation to that, not knowing when the pandemic will end, or when/if a cure will be found is anxiety inducing. But I would prefer to know less about this, until something is concrete. Whilst being inside for long periods of time can add to the symptoms of depression, I currently feel good about using this extra time to work on personal projects.",6,Fear,9,6,9,9,7,3,5,1,"I am frustrated that the choices the government are making, to move the UK out of lockdown, don't seem to be considerate of what we have learned from what has happened previously. I am anxious because children are returning to schools without being vaccinated, despite them previously being referred to as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""super spreaders"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I am worried that we are making steps that will lead to the NHS becoming overwhelmed again and that there will be more deaths.

I am not an anxious person but the current situation is making me feel slightly anxious as to when I will be able to get back out to the golf course and begin to improve again. This main anxiety is coming from my inability to do my job which sort of gives me a feeling of pointlessness at the moment.",3,Disgust,6,7,1,4,4,5,4,6,"I feel that the restrictions have gone on too long. I am a healthy young adult trying to make my way in my career (and therefore contribute) to society. However, all the restrictions have prevented ,e doing so and have potentially ruined the course of my career. The heavy handed approach seems to have no end. This sacrifice was so that old and fat people are more likely to survive. Absolutely galling that the economy has been crippled for the sake of people who have put themselves in a position where they are more liable to ill effects of the virus or people who can more or less choose to isolate if they wish.

As stated, this is an incredibly dark and dystopian time for the Country and the World, I can only hope that when the dust has settled those culpable will be held to account, be it financially or criminally.

I haven't once felt sad throughout the outbreak.",6,Desire,4,5,5,6,3,4,4,6,"Feel positive towards the fact that vaccines are being given to a lot of people on a daily basis. However, I do feel that people will suddenly think that once they have a vaccine that they can't get Covid, which isn't true. I still see a lot of people disregarding social distancing, and this makes me slightly annoyed. I've found that a lot of people are complaining about others during covid, but don't actually follow the rules themselves. I believe there are still quite a lot of hurdles and challenges to get through before life gets back to 'normal' e.g. convincing anti vax people to vaccinate, as well as certain bubbles of the population."

1138,8,Anxiety,6,6,7,7,7,3,6,2,"This is a very stressful time. Not least because of the deaths and illness occurring. Isolation is also leading to illness and deaths through suicide. It's scary to think about how individuals, particularly those at risk, are coping. As someone with a mental health difficulty I find it easier to cope in times of chaos, albeit it seems confusing to me the state of the world and uncertainty we are facing. Being in 'lock-down' is a very necessary step, and it angers me that some individuals are not following the guidance and advice put in place. Conspiracy theories also anger me, such as with 5G, as it trivialises the situation at hand",6,Anxiety,7,6,8,8,6,3,3,1,"I am scared mainly about schools opening, I feel the UK government has been very poor in their handling of the pandemic and I don't believe this will change.

I am angry about the ex Ofsted chief suggesting teachers should be prepared to sacrifice their lives for this pandemic - have lives not been sacrificed enough. I am scared we have all become desensitised to death figures or ICU figures etc. that hearing of people dying due to covid means less to the normal person - every death is a death which shouldn't have happened - its horrible"

My Friends, partner and wider family are fine and in good health, and my job is highly unlikely to be at risk no matter how long the lockdown continues. I own my house and therefore have no worries about landlord issues. I hope that the situation resolves itself as quickly as possible for the benefit of the whole world, but I am suitably prepared for things to get worse before they potentially get better.",6,Anxiety,2,1,3,8,4,5,6,5,"I feel more positive now because, with the vaccine rollout, the vulnerable have more protection. I am still anxious about vulnerable family members catching it, but less than before because of the vaccine. However I will be much happier when they finally receive their second dose of the vaccine. I am hopeful about the positives as life slowly returns to normal in the coming months. I am anxious about returning to work though. I feel that this will again increase my chances of contracting the virus. I am also missing family members who I have been unable to see for a very long time."
1140,3,Relaxation,1,3,3,2,3,5,6,4,"From seeing the daily death rate increasing and people still getting infected is not great, plus with some of the public still believing they are 'immune' or the lockown rules don't apply to them is frustrating for all who are trying to handle the situation. The press inform regularly but not to the level of scaring people into a frenzy. Panic buying has declined a great deal, social distancing seems to work for a high majority where I live but some still don't get the need to look after themselves and each other. Have signed a petition to see if live animal markets have tighter controls if not banned in China, as I believe that countries with this level of mentality should know better, change their barbaric ways. I understand food sources are a requirement, but needs far better control especially where the pandemic has run rife throughout the world (this all depends on truth of the source of covid19)",2,Relaxation,1,1,1,1,1,5,8,7,"Even though everyone around the world is in lickdown of some sort, i feel that we as a race have managed to navigate through a one-in-a-lifetime experience that (hopefully) generations to come wont have to live through. Personally i'm feeling optimistic, but also understand this shift to a 'new normal' may continue for some time, plus economies may find things hard to start with until we're back to as close as pre-covid normal.

1151,9,Anxiety,7,7,9,9,5,4,2,6,"The current situation makes me feel incredibly anxious. i have never been in a place in my life when I was worried about being able to feed myself. Whilst I know shops are open and have plenty of stock, its making sure you can make full, nutritious meals with those ingredients whilst navigating a store which you can no longer use your usual routes in and people are increasingly rude. This causes a lot of anxiety day to day as I am fully responsible for cooking and shopping for myself and two other adults. I also feel absolutely disgusted over the behaviour of others at the minute, as they have no thought for other people. Their reckless behaviour could kill someone and the thought that their recklessness could even lead to me being responsible for killing someone is absolutely terrifying. The lack of leadership in this country is also leaving me rather confused about the whole situation and how it will progress, leaving me fearful of what is really to come.",5,Anxiety,6,6,5,7,4,4,4,6,"I feel a lot of disgust and anger towards the government for its gross mishandling of the current situation. I fear that people will become complacent too soon with the children returning to schools despite the data showing that schools cause a massive rise in cases. I also feel slightly optimistic that we may be nearing a point where things can become more normal with the mass introduction of the vaccine, though I fear that if the June date isn't stuck to the country will become complacent on any measures."
1152,7,Anxiety,6,3,8,9,6,2,1,4,"I feel out of control. Overwhelmed by this situation. Overwhelmed by news about it in social media and other information channels. I feel highly anxious. I feel if restrictions would be stricter, we could deal with the situation faster. I feel not well informed. I feel lost and scared. I'm worried. I'm slightly angry with people who still don't take this situation seriously. I'm tired and I think that it will be even worse. I have constant negative thoughts and I cannot focus on anything else. I am worrying about the future, about tomorrow, this week... I'm worried about next month and next few months.",7,Anxiety,7,6,7,9,8,3,1,2,"I'm still anxious. Many people behave like they are fine with the situation, but circumstances are still the same. Deadly virus is flying around. We are not vaccinated, vaccine is not working in 100 percent, virus have more and more variants, so nothing really changed. I'm frustrated, have enough and I worry a lot. I would like this to be over and I'm angry, because it could be of people would behave and have some common sense. I'm also frustrated, because I see many people (online) that are denying the virus, it's possible outcome or vaccination program. I'm sad that there is so many things that we cannot do or miss out.
